But should society “live with terrorism” to avoid letting it undermine our freedoms?\n",
		"article_content": "It happens sometimes that a public figure feeling a need to comment in response to a crisis blurts out something that shames himself and his constituents.  Such was the fate of French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who started out well enough on Friday when he said that France “will not give in to the terrorist threat,” but then added, “Times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism, and we must face this together and share our collective sang-froid.  France is a great country and a great democracy, and we will not allow ourselves to be destabilized.”Quel dommage; quelle absurdité.Terrorism -- of the Islamist variety, which we are likely to find we are dealing with here -- is not a fairly static and statistical phenomenon, like automobile accidents or slips in the bathtub, which our own president, in a Valls-like moment, reminded us claim more lives than terrorism.  It results from the purposeful conduct of people who are motivated by two things: an overly literal reading of Islamic scripture, and success.  Their goal is to impose their will on the world -- or as much of it as possible -- by shaking the confidence of citizens that their governments can do what governments principally are there for, which is to keep them safe.   The more successful attacks terrorists mount, the more adherents they attract.  Neither automobile accidents nor bathtub slips have that effect.We can support those who do not embrace a view that leads to terrorism, and not credential apologists for the contrary view; and we can do something about the success part. That means gathering intelligence not simply to strengthen our defenses, but to go on offense.  Because the United States remains the world’s only superpower, that is likely to mean that we would bear the principal burden.If we don’t do anything, we can take Valls’s advice, and learn to live with terrorism until we learn to die with it.

		"instruction": "Headline: China’s Coming Economic Crisis?\nInstructions: In a recent New Yorker article, John Cassidy asked if China is the next Lehman Brothers. That query has been around for a while, but it’s still worth exploring: Is China headed toward a financial crisis? Should China shift its economic model toward more consumer spending and services? If so, how should it go about doing so? \n",
		"article_content": "For the past two decades, any sign of slowdown in China has been greeted with headline-grabbing proclamations of China’s impending financial collapse. And each time, nothing even close to collapse has occurred.  Yes, China confronts major challenges to properly regulate runaway local government debt and shadow banking. Yes, China’s G.D.P. relies excessively on investment, much of it inefficiently spent on state-owned enterprises or excessive property development. And yes, China faces headwinds that almost surely will slow economic growth, including rapid population aging and the end of easy growth from structural change and catch-up growth.However, to declare calamity on the basis of these challenges belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the Chinese economy and how it is managed. First, not all of the investments have been bad, and China still has some room to run before reaching relative income levels at which growth slowed substantially in countries like Japan and Korea. Second, China’s banks and households are not plagued with highly leveraged real estate debt. Many homeowners who benefited from housing reforms own their houses outright while many others purchased housing at market prices well below current valuations. Regulations restrict the purchase of multiple homes and require down payments equal to 30 and 60 percent of loan value for first and second home purchases. In any case, China’s central government can easily recapitalize banks if necessary. Even though central and local government debt now total more than $5 trillion compared to a G.D.P. of $9 trillion, the Chinese central government also controls $3.9 trillion in foreign reserves and $7.4 trillion in state enterprise assets (local state owned enterprises have similar value). Moreover, China’s government officials are now aware of the key challenges and are taking steps to address them.It is true that China’s investment share of G.D.P. is extreme -- nearly 50 percent, making a shift to consumption-driven growth desirable. The government can spend more on public services and strengthen social insurance programs, since citizens who feel more financially secure will save less for precautionary reasons and spend more. More important, it can promote job and income growth by undertaking fundamental, long-awaited reforms that liberalize the key macro prices (exchange rate, interest rate), open up the capital account; promote greater factor mobility by dismantling the household registration system and clarifying land property rights; and improve state-owned enterprise performance by diversifying ownership and introducing greater competition.

		"instruction": "Headline: Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?\nInstructions: This summer, Tennessee will begin allowing faculty and staff at public colleges and universities to carry weapons on campus and Texas will allow concealed carry not just on campus but in university buildings and classrooms. The Georgia Legislature considered similar measures but the governor vetoed the bill earlier this month. That brings the number to 10 states that allow guns on campus. Is this a good idea? \n",
		"article_content": "Some lawmakers now believe that allowing students to carry their own weapons is a feasible solution to preventing mass shootings on college campuses. Simply put, students do not want guns on their college campuses. Along with 13 student body presidents in Texas, representing a total of more than 300,000 students, I signed a letter asking state legislators to reject a bill that would allow guns in college cafeterias, dorms and classrooms.According to the F.B.I., mass shootings account for less than 2 percent of gun-related deaths, while suicide accounts for roughly 61 percent of gun-related deaths. College students are more likely to use a gun on themselves than to protect themselves during a mass shooting. After a year of serving as student body president, I have seen more public safety issues arise from improper mental health care than criminal violence. I’ve seen students committed to the psychiatric ward and balconies at dormitories locked because of suicide attempts; I've had a student come to my room in tears confessing that he wanted to kill himself. Never once in my tenure did I experience a moment where guns would have contributed to student wellbeing.In Texas, there is no assault weapons ban, no magazine capacity restriction and no mandated background check for private sales. These weak state laws would exacerbate the risk of tragedy on campus should guns be introduced.  As someone who grew up with firearms at home, I’ve seen that responsible gun ownership can create a sense of security. But it requires that a gun owner has extensive training, can ensure their weapons are secured at all times, and is capable of exercising sound judgement at a moment's notice. Unfortunately, this describes a campus police officer and not your average college student. If allowing students to own guns is truly about empowerment, we should listen to students when they say they don’t want guns on campus. Misguided initiatives from lawmakers should not trump the concerns of students. "

		"instruction": "Headline: Can a Few Years’ Data Reveal Bad Teachers?\nInstructions: With years of data, it seems possible to distinguish good teachers from poor ones. Does that indicate that, after collecting two or three years’ data on each new hire, districts should be using test scores for decisions about firings, tenure and pay?\n",
		"article_content": "We all agree that teachers can make a tremendous difference in the lives of students, and we all can remember a great teacher who was important in our own lives. The challenge is to identify more great teachers. Value-added measures, which rate teachers based on their impacts on students’ test scores, can help us do so. Our recent study shows that when a high-value-added teacher enters a school, test scores for students in the grade taught by that teacher rise immediately (as shown in the figure below). And the gains don’t stop there: the students who learn from that teacher are more likely to attend college, earn more, and are less likely to have children as teenagers. Even when new teachers are evaluated with just a few years of data, those who get high value-added ratings produce large gains for their students.While our findings show that improving teacher value-added would have large returns for students, it’s less clear how to achieve this goal in practice. One problem is that evaluating teachers using test scores could encourage counterproductive behaviors, such as teaching to the test or even cheating. These responses may reduce — but are unlikely to completely eliminate — the benefits of using test scores for evaluation. The best way to rate teachers most likely combines test score value-added ratings with other information, like principal or peer evaluations based on classroom observation.More generally, we should recognize that value-added data can be a useful statistic even though it’s not perfect, just like performance measures in other occupations. The manager of a baseball team pays attention to a player’s batting average even though it too is an imperfect statistic that bounces around over time. If a new player gets no hits in his first month, one option is waiting to see whether he is just in a temporary slump. Another is more coaching. But on occasion, the best option may be to let that player go and call up a replacement.Few insist on equity irrespective of performance, both in sports and many other professions, so why would this be the norm in teaching? The stakes in teaching are much larger than winning or losing a game; teachers impact hundreds of children over their careers. Teaching should be recognized and rewarded as an elite profession, one which attracts and retains the most talented stars. When combined with other measures of teacher performance, objective data on test score value-added can help us find the star teachers who will shape the next generation.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

W.J. Mayo, the founder of the Mayo Clinic, said that by 2011, the average life span, then only 54, would rise to 70 (it is 77.9). The physicist Arthur Compton, noting China's rise,  said \"science will no longer be a monopoly of the West.\" William Ogburn, a sociologist, said \"people will become more nervous and mental disorders will rise for a time, but by 2011 mental hygienists will probably have the upper hand.\"   Even though prognostications turn out to be wrong as often as they are right, why do they have such enduring appeal? What purpose have they served, from ancient times to our information  age? \n",
		"article_content": "Ever since the manuscript of Jules Verne’s second and most accurate novel, “Paris in the Twentieth Century,” was rejected by his publisher in part for implausibility (\"[E]ven if you were a prophet, no one today would believe this prophecy...\") and hidden away in 1863, prediction has been perilous. More recently, our ability to design new objects and organisms has been growing geometrically, while our skill at modeling their long-term risks increases only arithmetically, as too many artificial hip recipients can testify. Early space travel visionaries did not fully understand the challenges of radiation and lunar dust  that astronauts will face on any extended missions.Long-term environmental and social change can be even harder to predict. Three patterns may seem equally plausible: extrapolation, saturation and oscillation. What will continue indefinitely, what will level off and what will reverse itself — perhaps cycling back again? Well into the mid-20th century, at least, most atmospheric scientists followed a self-stabilizing model of climate change, despite early predictions of the hazards of global warming. They also initially ignored the damage that chlorofluorcarbons were  inflicting cumulatively on the ozone layer; originally these chemicals were miracle gases that replaced hazardous refrigerator chemicals and helped create the modern home appliance industry.Mistaken forecasting also retarded nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels. Even before the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the nuclear industry was cutting back on new plant construction, in part because it extrapolated a drop in demand that proved temporary. On the other hand, the accurate prediction of some nuclear executives in 1980 (at least according to one recent expert panel) that the technology could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions went largely unheeded. (And in turn, who knows what the further long-term consequences of expanding nuclear power will be?) Meanwhile, container shipping  has changed both energy use and the world economy beyond the dreams of its pioneers over 50 years ago. But sometimes there’s value even to inaccurate prognostications. The economist Irving Fisher continues to be ridiculed for his prediction in October 1929 that the stock market had reached a permanently high plateau. Yet this failure helped inspire him to further studies that are of growing interest now. And given his stature in the 1920s, if he had instead warned of a crash in 1928, it probably would have happened earlier, and he’d be blamed for having started it. Besides, excessive optimism in the late 1920s boom gave us masterpieces like the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building and the Waldorf-Astoria. And while technocratic consultants were wrongly pessimistic about the prospects for the original Xerox copier, dry photocopying and the revolution it brought probably would have been delayed for years if, in the Depression, Chester Carlson hadn’t been equally unrealistic about the obstacles his ideas would face before a marketable version could be built. Yet soon after its introduction fifty years ago, it was called the most immediately profitable invention of all time. We could use more of that old-school irrational exuberance. Societies, like individuals, sometimes need positive illusions.\n"

		"instruction": "Headline: Does Pornography Deserve Its Bad Rap?\nInstructions: Even the critics who say pornography is predictable would have to acknowledge some surprises this year. An author argued that consumers’ lust for pornography led to world-changing innovations like the Internet. And H.I.V. experts have called the industry a strangely effective model for reducing the risk of promiscuous sex — even without condoms, which L.A. County now requires.But neither of these claims will silence the two loudest criticisms of pornography: that it exploits performers and that it rewires the minds of the women, men and adolescents who watch it.Is pornography a social ill? Or are there benefits to be recognized, if it creates rewarding work and offers entertainment, education and inspiration?\n",
		"article_content": "Like people whose lives have been affected by pornography, researchers who have asked “Is pornography harmful?” understand that the answer must be “It depends.” Can pornography harm users? Yes, in some cases it can, but in the vast majority of cases it does not. Can pornography be beneficial? Absolutely, but many times it is not.Important distinctions should be made between the types of materials people are using when trying to understand pornography’s effects.  Across numerous studies, both laboratory-based and surveys, my colleagues and I have found erotica (nonviolent, nondegrading, sexually explicit material) is positively perceived by both men and women and is typically not associated with negative outcomes.  In contrast, violent and degrading pornography is negatively perceived by women (but not men) and is associated with lower relationship and sexual satisfaction in both men and women.Another important consideration is the motivation for pornography use.  When use is motivated by a personal desire for sexual gratification only, it is often associated with lower relationship and sexual satisfaction.  In contrast, use that is shared by partners or incorporated into lovemaking is often associated with higher satisfaction (and its content is usually erotic rather than pornographic; many of these materials are specifically marketed to couples).  Numerous sex therapists have encouraged their clients to incorporate erotica into their relationships, with successful results for the couple.\n \nAs with alcohol, pornography’s effects may be primarily determined by how frequently it is consumed.  Occasional use is rarely problematic (for users or partners of users), while frequent use can become quite intrusive, even in relationships in which people are in principle open to pornography. Frequent use may result in boredom and habituation to the content of pornography, leaving users to seek ever-more-thrilling or novel materials.  Some of the men we have been treating for problematic pornography use report being concerned that the content of the pornography they view has become increasingly degrading or violent, and they worry about how far this may progress.Finally, the bigger impact of degrading and objectifying representations of sex may be harmful to all members of a society, even those who do not consume pornography, by creating a cultural climate in which people are reduced to body parts to be used for personal sexual gratification.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

		"article_content": "Over 3,000 years ago, King Solomon wrote, “Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.” Telling your friends something they really don’t want to hear, like warning them about a relationship, takes courage. It says that you care about the person even more than you value the friendship.If you want to be a faithful friend by speaking your concerns out loud, how you deliver the message may be the difference between a broken and a deepened friendship. There is a very fine line between saying you are concerned and saying you judge your friend’s decision. Let him (or her) know that no matter what he may decide, you will always be in his corner. Remember that you can be consistently supportive of a person without agreeing with his decisions. It is also better to have one intentional conversation about your concerns, rather than constantly making remarks (like a nagging mother). You may even tell your friend, “I’m only going to bring this up once. It won’t come up again unless you ask.” After you have voiced your concerns, do your best to encourage your friend even if he chooses not to take your advice. And a cardinal rule for marriage also applies to friendship. No one likes to hear “I told you so.” In a day when “friendships” come and go as easily as choosing a Facebook status, true friends are hard to find. What a gift to have a friend who will risk telling you the truth to your face instead of chattering behind your back.

		"article_content": "Can the United States be more like Denmark, or any of the other Scandinavian nations?  Indeed, it can so long as Americans are willing to follow a few simple steps.  First and foremost, Americans would need to pay more in taxes, and that tax burden would fall predominantly on the middle class. Marginal tax rates as high as the U.S. rate kick in at a much lower income level in Scandinavian countries.  For instance, in Denmark, plumbers pay the same 50 percent income tax as hedge fund managers.  And there’s also  a 25 percent value added tax on most purchases (180 percent on car purchases), far above the 7 percent average sales tax in most states.    Pretax income per capita is 23 percent higher in the U.S. than in Denmark. And because so much is raised from consumption taxes, in general things are more expensive in Scandinavian countries. For example, a beer in Denmark will cost you 75 percent more in than in the U.S., a coffee a third more, a dozen eggs 40 percent more. Housing in Denmark  is also more expensive than in the U.S. and on average homes are smaller.  Danish university students have their tuition paid for them by the state. But there is no choice between public and private institutions. Nor do students have the same freedom to study what they please as in the U.S. Students apply to study a specific subject.  None of this liberal arts nonsense about the nation needing well-rounded citizens.  And how hard it is for high school graduates to study the subject of their choice depends on whether the Ministry of Education thinks the country needs more graduates in that field. The government adjusts the G.P.A. requirement for admission depending on how many majors it anticipates needing.  \n \nSo can we be more like Scandinavia?  Yes.  Will we?  Unlikely."

(A man claiming to be the father of the girl, Chifundo James known as Mercy, has come forward demanding custody.)This view of international adoption is also held by Unicef.\nWhat should the standard be for allowing international adoptions?\n",
		"article_content": "As a psychologist working with foster and adopted children and their families, I find puzzling some of the negative public reactions to Madonna’s efforts to adopt Mercy. Madonna seems to be trying to improvethis child’s life.\nWhatever her motives, she is raising the profile of international adoption and drawing attention to the plight of destitute children around the world. Research shows that children do best when raised in a supportive,caring family. Mercy has a much better chance of thriving in a family environment with personal attention, educational opportunities and medical care than in an orphanage.\nThat said, it’s also important to consider the issue of race in international adoptions. Of course, one should meet the standards for an appropriate caregiver (as Madonna has done, given that the Malawi governmentallowed her to adopt her son, David). Additionally, parents should make a concerted effort to learn more about the culture of the child they are adopting.\nTo establish a sense of continuity for a child who has experienced considerable upheaval, it is advisable to maintain contact, when possible, with people who were significant in the child’s life in the birthcountry. Throughout the child’s formative years, parents would also do well to nourish the child’s link to the birth culture through educational activities, language programs, cultural events, travel.The adoption process should include counseling about these matters.\nParents in trans-racial adoptions must anticipate tricky situations with family, friends, school personnel and others in their social circle who might be uncomfortable with the child’s race. And they need toprepare strategies for confronting negative messages and stereotypes.\nIn placement decisions for domestic adoptions in the United States, race and ethnicity are still prominent. Obsession with the race of the prospective caregiver is understandable, given the painful history of blacks’oppression in this country. In 1996, Congress passed a law that made it easier for parents to adopt a child of another race, but in my experience placement decisions still rely heavily on matching the race and ethnicityof the caregiver and child.\nWhile it is best for parents and adopted children to be of similar race and ethnicity, studies show that black children languish, unplaced, in the foster care system for much longer than other children do. It is importantto get them out of the system and place them with loving families.\nWhat’s more, using race as the primary criterion in adoption placement is not always in the best interest of the child, especially when there are not enough color-matching caregivers who meet the other standardsfor adoption. I’m hopeful that with the Obama presidency, more people will realize that race is only one factor in our multifaceted identity.\nMadonna seems willing to do much for this child. Her critics should pause from composing online screeds about her motives and give her the benefit of the doubt. Instead, they should ask themselves: “What am Idoing to relieve the suffering of countless destitute children.\n"

Yet we survived and thrived. In 1968, the last presidential election before passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act, Eugene McCarthy got his influential anti-war campaign off the ground in days, thanks to a handful of wealthy individuals who contributed the equivalent of several million each in today's dollars. On the other hand, candidates who have been most successful at small dollar fundraising tend to be on the fringes of mainstream politics -- think of George McGovern, Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul, for example.People say that they think campaign contributions corrupt, but what they seem to mean is that they think that contributions corrupt their political opponents. Polling shows that voters whose party lost the last election are far more likely to think government is corrupt. But President Obama’s supporters don’t think he is corrupt, and nor do Mitt Romney’s. Few people believe that their candidate is corrupted by contributions, or that his sources of funding will change his preferred policies, how he governs, or whom he appoints to office.

As agreed upon at the United Nations, the international community bears a formalized responsibility to protect the people of Libya. More specifically, we agreed “to take timely and decisive action to prevent and halt mass atrocities” precisely because we have failed to take such action in the past.Unlike Rwanda in 1994 or Bosnia in 1995, in Libya we face neither a genocide with early warning signs nor a strictly humanitarian crisis. Beyond threatening the lives and security of a population of more than six million Libyans, Colonel Qaddafi’s actions directly challenge the administration’s commitment to advancing human dignity — smack in the middle of a region at the forefront of U.S. security interests. If we don’t act to stop the killing in Libya, how can the U.S. credibly encourage the Egyptian military to hold free and fair elections, push for commitments to nonviolence by new political parties, and — critical to greater stability in the region — convince the last-standing Arab autocrats to reform? But deciding to act requires understanding where our leverage with Colonel Qaddafi and his henchmen lies.  Do assets matter against power? Beyond the challenges of establishing a no-flight zone, will one prevent murderers from fighting on the ground? The sad reality in the case of Libya is that we have no clear playbook. So far, the best strategy may be the administration’s approach to other recent uprisings: focus on nonviolence and let Libyans be the primary players. With international partners who share this responsibility, the U.S. should intervene as necessary to promote these goals and to fulfill our responsibility to protect civilians and to end the violence.

But each author may approach the problem differently. How should Western authors and artists deal with Chinese government censorship? Accept or negotiate changes, or decline to have their work published at all?\n",
		"article_content": "The Chinese publishers can be quite accommodating if you negotiate over edits. My advice to writers and editors is to begin by demanding that no changes be made to the text of your book. If the publisher refuses, you need to find out why. It could be for market reasons. Sometimes shortening a book makes it more marketable in a foreign market.If the changes are for political reasons, then identify the passages that your Chinese publisher wants to cut out. Sometimes the cuts are innocuous and acceptable, while other times they may compromise the integrity of your book. Then it is up to you to decide whether to accept the Chinese translation or not.\n \nBut to understand what the publisher wants to do to the book, you need to have her hire a mutually acceptable third-party reader, usually a respectable Chinese academic, to assess the quality of the translation on your behalf. You’d be amazed how flexible a Chinese publisher can be if the company really wants your book. But if you don’t demand it, you won’t get it, and the publisher may change the text of your book for convenience sake without telling you.\n \nWithout hiring a third-party reader, you will also not know how bad the translation is: In a majority of cases, the translations are shoddy and inaccurate without the authors knowing it. This is often more damaging than government censorship.\n \nBut government censorship does add to the problem. Chinese publishers routinely screen out sensitive words and unsavory opinions before they submit the books to the censors. Again, most of the time this is done without informing the authors. And this makes third-party review of translated books even more important. It is not common for publishers to agree to it, but there are already precedents.\n \nIt is very worthwhile to have one’s book published in China, given China’s global importance and its potentially huge readership. But you and your agent need to work extra hard in negotiating the best terms.\n "

In addition, there should be swift and significant moves toward economic sanctions on Sudan involving aid, trade and political pressure through international bodies like the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The Nuba situation needs to be closely monitored, and if it deteriorates toward genocide, then, to stop it, Sudan should be told that “all options remain on the table.”The current crisis, in which hundreds of thousands of Nuba are huddled in caves under attack from government forces, has to be seen in the context of what happened in the 1990s, when up to half a million Nuba were killed in what some have described as a genocide. The Nuba are a mountain people who have been resistant to central rule for centuries, and in the 1990s the Sudanese government attempted to end the “Nuba problem” through bombing and starving the population. Last year, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir threatened to force the Nuba \"back into the mountains and prevent them from having food just as we did before.” This is happening now. There is undoubtedly little appetite for intervention. While it was successful with the Kurds in Iraq, the results in Libya are not so clear. That is why the world community looks on helplessly as President Bashar al-Assad continues to butcher his people in Syria. We must never forget the grave consequences of nonintervention in places like Rwanda. According to its own ideals, America stands for justice, equality, human rights and a civil society based in knowledge and compassion. These same qualities describe the ideal Muslim society. Ironically, Sudan sees itself as an Islamic nation. Its leaders need to be reminded that what they are doing to the Nuba is far from these ideals.

But much of that violence is cartoonishly sterilized and bloodless to ensure the movies maintain a rating that can attract young ticket buyers.Some argue this shows how meaningless the rating system is, but others ask whether this “sugarcoating of violence” in PG-13 films makes for a more enjoyable movie-going experience.Is it irresponsible to portray conflict without its gory consequences?\n",
		"article_content": "We witness fictional acts of violence all the time at the movies, in PG-13 flicks and otherwise, and there's certainly a conversation to be had about our desensitization to that. But the conversation should also acknowledge that violent shoot-em-up art is a reflection of our times.This month, we witnessed one of the most horrific mass shootings in American history. Federal authorities are still looking for clues into Omar Mateen's motivations for killing and wounding so many in Orlando, Fla. — and there could have been many different ones — but what is not fully acknowledged is the American pattern he fits into. Bluntly stated, the core of American values is rooted in violence. U.S. history is rife with acts of violence perpetuated against many different communities. Mass shootings are not aberrations — they are a continuation of a legacy of hate and violence, threaded through American culture and society. And if we're sugarcoating that violence in PG-13 movies — to attract younger movie goers, no less — we shouldn't be. Let them see the consequences of violence, in fiction and in the news. Perhaps a more visceral response to it could finally prompt Congress to pass gun control measures.Violence in movies and video games certainly contributes to aggression, but are they causal or correlative? That's not a question we can answer. But the prevalence of the AR-15 rifle isn't debatable. The prevalence of gun violence in America is not debatable. And there is no doubt that violence has its own starring role on the big screen. "

		"article_content": "The G.O.P.’s huge victory Tuesday presents the party with a unique opportunity to get something done  with President Obama on immigration reform.  Make no mistake, the hard anti-immigrant faction within the Republican Party wants no part of a deal. But if party leaders are smart, they’ll ignore the minority within their party on this issue, especially if they hope to win the White House and retain their Congressional leadership in 2016.  Immigration was basically a nonfactor in the 2014 elections — despite Senator Ted Cruz’s laughable assertion on Election Night that opposition to amnesty helped drive the G.O.P.’s gains.  Few competitive races took place in states with large Hispanic populations. In Colorado, the one exception, the Republican senator-elect, Corey Gardner, avoided the immigration minefield by not pandering to the anti-immigrant wing of his party. Hispanic turnout was down nationally by some 2 percentage points over 2012, according to exit polls. Even more important, Hispanics gave Democrats only a 28-point edge, compared with Obama's 44-point edge in 2012.So what can the party do that might actually move the immigration issue forward? First, tackle legal immigration reform.  A simple fix to expand the numbers of people admitted legally would be to rollover unused green cards from the previous decades, which could allow about 250,000 more visas. In addition, there is broad support among Republicans for making it easier to admit skilled workers our economy needs.  This includes workers in specialized fields like science, technology, engineering and math, so increasing the number of H1B visas for STEM workers is a no-brainer, but the G.O.P. needs to go further.  One option is to expand work permits overall and create a broader guest worker program for agriculture, meat processing and certain service sectors. The G.O.P. could come up with creative solutions to allow employers to sponsor long-time undocumented employees who may already be working in such jobs, provided they’ve paid their taxes and maintained a clean record and live in mixed-status households with one or more legal residents or U.S. citizens.  In addition, the G.O.P. could pass ENLIST, a Republican-sponsored bill that would provide permanent legal status to those undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and enlist in the military. But all of this requires cooperation from the White House.  If President Obama takes executive action to adjust the status of millions of illegal immigrants without working with Congress, he’s likely to set back immigration reform for years. "

To do so, however, they will have to pass academic tests known as board exams. If they don’t pass the tests in the 10th grade, they can take them again in their juniorand senior years.\nThe National Center on Education and the Economy, the nonprofit group that is organizing the program, says that students will have to meet basicrequirements before they go to college and that it hopes this will reduce the need for remedial classes in college.\nA fast-track approach, which is focused on “at risk” students, is already in place at 71 North Carolina high schools, and is spreadingin New York, California and Texas.\nWhat are the benefits of a fast-track approach through high school? What are the possible problems and risks?\n",

Exactly who would benefit from a grade 10 “board” exam whose “passing score would be set at the level necessary to succeed in first-year collegecourses”? Not students who can pass a grade 10 exam covering authentic Algebra II material.\nWill the “board” exams be based on lower standards, so more at-risk students can go to community college?\nThose students should be encouraged to stay in high school and continue their studies so that they can graduate from high school and enroll in a full four-year academic program in college. Students who barelypass Algebra I in grade 10?\nNot unless there is a behind-the-scenes effort to compel community colleges to lower their math and English/reading standards or requirements so these students can take credit-bearing math courses in their freshmanyear.\nIf the goal lurking behind this scheme is to get low-performing grade 10 students into post-secondary technical training, it is beginning far too late. The largest number of high school dropouts do so in grade9.\nThis country should be developing first-rate grades 9-12 technical/career high schools for high, medium or low-performing students in grade 8 to consider enrolling in. That is the counterpart to what other countriesdo. They don’t push low-performing students into credit-bearing college courses.\nInstead, they give all students in the middle grades the opportunity to choose an occupational or academic secondary school or, as in Denmark and Germany, a paying apprenticeship in a manufacturing firm.\nNow it is clear why Common Core’s “College- and Career-Readiness Standards” were not crafted to prepare high school students for authentic four-year academic college programs. As explainedin a White Paper to be released soon by Pioneer Institute, they are barely at a grade 10 level. The proposed “Board” exam sounds exactly likethe test to be based on these low standards.\n"

If passed, the law would make New Hampshire the 19th state to abolish capital punishment. The United States, the only country in the Americas to practice the death penalty last year, executed 39 people, four fewer than the year before, and Texas accounted for 41 percent of them, according to Amnesty International. As executions become concentrated in fewer and fewer states and racial disparities continue, does the application of capital punishment make it unconstitutionally cruel and unusual? \n",
		"article_content": "When capital punishment was more common, it was easy to claim that people are executed because they are criminals.  But now that fewer criminals receive the death penalty, that's no longer the case, and there are compelling reasons to argue that African-Americans are disproportionately subject to the death penalty not because of their crime, but because of their race. With only 2 percent of American counties imposing the majority of death sentences, capital punishment is the most “unusual” it’s ever been in United States history.  But application of the death penalty remains so unequal that it offends both the U.S. Constitution and international human rights law. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, most death penalty studies that look at race indicate that a defendant is more likely to receive the death penalty if the victim is white, rather than black. What's more, backs are disproportionately represented on death row compared to their proportion in the general population. To try to moderate race-based executions, North Carolina’s “Racial Justice Act” allowed people sentenced to death to introduce statistical evidence that their punishment was influenced by race.  You might think politicians would be too embarrassed to repeal something called “The Racial Justice Act” but that’s exactly what the state’s legislators did in 2013.   Essentially the law was too successful: executions in North Carolina ground to a halt because almost every capital defendant could produce evidence that his sentence had been influenced by race.  The first African-American president might show some leadership on this issue.  When President Obama spoke out about another social justice issue – same sex marriage – it sparked a sea change in public attitudes and, eventually, the law.  \n \nObama’s varying positions on marriage equality and capital punishment have the same quality of waffling between doing the morally right thing and doing the politically expedient thing.  Before he ran for president, Obama was for marriage equality and against capital punishment.  As a candidate, he changed his positions.  After the election, Obama “evolved” on gay marriage to support it, again.  Mr. President, evolve already on capital punishment. You would promote the Constitution’s requirements of fair punishment and equal justice under the law.  And you would help prevent people from being killed because they are black.\n \n"

Rather than simple aesthetics or stylistic currency, then, we should consider the innovation and architectural significance of these places and the ways in which they advance our understanding of building design.\n \nAnd, before we consign unpopular buildings or architectural styles to the wrecking ball, let’s remember that if no one had spoken up for South Beach’s Art Deco treasures years ago, we would have lost an essential, successful and iconic piece of our American fabric.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

		"article_content": "President Obama’s new “Buffett rule” is more a guideline than a rule, because his plan offers no details on how to implement it. Regardless of what it’s called, though, this precept can only impede serious discussion of tax reform and fiscal balance. To begin, Congressional Budget Office data show that millionaires, as a group, already pay a higher fraction of their income than the middle class in combined individual income taxes and payroll taxes. And, that doesn’t even include the corporate income taxes imposed on the income they receive from their stock holdings. The real question is not whether millionaires should pay more than the middle class, but whether they should pay more than they do today? Raising millionaires’ taxes may seem fair -- they can obviously afford to pay more. But, this policy has significant economic costs. Higher tax rates will encourage millionaires to report less taxable income, limiting the revenue inflow. And, the higher rates will discourage saving by the group that finances much of the business investment on which economic growth and wages depend.   If we’re willing to accept those costs, tax increases on millionaires can be part of the fiscal solution. But economists and commentators across the political spectrum agree that taxing the rich cannot be the full solution -- basic math shows that closing the fiscal gap will also require entitlement cuts and tax increases on the broad middle class. The president’s plan largely omits such measures, relying instead on ephemeral savings from cutting doctor and hospital payments and already counted savings from drawing down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s unfortunate that the president did not present a more balanced plan. But, it’s hard to blame him: Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have repeatedly vowed to never consider such a plan. In the end, the fiscal gap cannot be closed simply by taxing the rich or cutting discretionary spending.

		"article_content": "The prospect of targeting medical treatment to individuals or groups of similar individuals is exciting. But the recent enthusiasm for \"precision medicine\" is complicated by the diversity of people, as well as the vast variation in their circumstances.To develop a more holistic composite of what a person’s risks are, researchers need to expand their inquiry beyond genetic markers. The Obama administration’s $215 million plan for precision medicine defines it as an approach that accounts for “individual differences in people’s genes, environments and lifestyles,” but the enthusiasm for easier and less expensive genetic testing has focused much of the attention on that aspect of the initiative. Biological markers, social factors and environmental exposure all figure heavily in a person’s health.Then, there is the issue of health care disparities. When any new medical technology emerges, it usually benefits those with good insurance and high levels of education, people who would likely find out about novel medical solutions from specialized doctors. Members of racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be poor and uninsured, and are not usually at the forefront of research and treatment at cutting edge health centers. In order to involve historically overlooked groups of people, the research agenda should be shaped, in part, by health concerns of communities. For example, since 2010, the Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities has cultivated ties between researchers, community organizations, health service providers, public health agencies and policymakers in Baltimore to reduce the rate of high blood pressure among African-Americans. Community-based participatory research alleviates the mistrust that certain communities — especially traditionally underserved and socially disadvantaged populations — have for health care institutions, and gives researchers better opportunity to analyze how biomarkers and environments vary to affect health outcomes. The potential for improving health, and health disparities, on an individualized or community basis is tremendous, but this effort must be pursued as a collaborative and interdisciplinary study that involves the communities meant to benefit from it."

Our success, to no small degree, was attributable to the inspirational leadership of Jim and Sarah Brady and the advocacy of victims and survivors, but we also: chose our battles very carefully; met one-to-one with key legislators and swing votes; publicly discredited the N.R.A.’s extremist views, including its longstanding hostility to federal law enforcement; documented and promoted the effectiveness of background checks and other measures like one-gun-a-month sales; mobilized grass-roots leaders in swing districts to personally meet with or call their elected representatives; organized the support of law enforcement officials and national organizations; worked through our political action committee to win key legislative races; and waged an aggressive “earned” media campaign.

(On Wednesday, Mr. Zoellick in clarifying his comment, said he was not advocating a gold standard, but described gold prices as \"the elephant in the room\" that policymakers needed to acknowledge.)As The Financial Times noted, \"Although there are occasional calls for a return to using gold as an anchor for currency values, most policymakers and economists regard the idea as liable to lead to overly tight monetary policy with growth and unemployment taking the brunt of economic shocks.\"Would moving to a modified gold standard make sense in this global economic climate? Or would it make recovery more difficult? How might this work? \n",
		"article_content": "In a world with so many instabilities, there is an understandable search for something that offers a stable value – preferably something that cannot be affected by the whim of government or the latest scheme of a central bank. Unfortunately, this search proves just as illusory as the pursuits of alchemists in pre-modern times; there is no magic to gold.For international economic transactions, proposing any kind of return to the gold standard is equivalent to wanting more fixed exchange rates, i.e., moving away from market-determined rates and returning to the system, at least in part, to how it operated before 1971.But it is hard to imagine how this would help with regard to the major currencies, which are again the subject of controversy today. The main issues in the U.S. are high unemployment, an unstable financial system, and longer-term issues around the budget. How exactly would gold help on any dimension? Advocates of a modified gold standard argue that this would serve as a form of anchor to the system – but in the 1930s it proved to be an anchor tied around the neck of some countries, including the United States. Nobody needs the kind of “stability” associated with the Great Depression.And China’s exchange rate today is controversial precisely because it is essentially fixed in nominal terms against the dollar. Adding gold as a reference point for China’s exchange rate would do nothing to affect the problem – China keeps its currency undervalued in real terms, aiming for a large current account surplus. This is unfair and violates both the rules of the exchange rate system and the reasonable expectations of its trading partners.The world – and the G20 -- needs to confront its main problems: global banks have become far too powerful, financial reform has failed, and we are setting ourselves for another dangerous credit cycle – which will again devastate jobs. The G20, incredibly, has refused to take up the issue of how to handle the failure of megabanks when these operate across borders. The failure of leadership and responsibility at the Seoul summit is profound.Proposing a modified gold standard is at best a distraction. At worst, it may be latched onto by people who wish to further divert us from the real problems."

Is there a way to ensure that ballot language is less confusing? \n\n",
		"article_content": "Some ballot measures — those developed by legislatures — are drafted by legislative attorneys who take pride in their craft. Drafters try to eliminate ambiguity, opaqueness and open-ended questions. They work from legislative drafting manuals that outline clear style and possibly plain language, too. After a bill is drafted, the legislative sponsor reviews and introduces it. From that point on, the bill is open to scrutiny from fellow lawmakers and the public. The wording is likely to be edited time and again through subcommittee hearings, committee hearings, on the floor, in the second chamber, in conference committees and — if there’s threat of a veto — in consultation with the governor.The same is not true for citizen initiatives that can be included on ballots in the 24 states that allow citizens to propose changes to statutes or the state’s constitution. These efforts, drafted by amateurs, do not have the benefit of the careful review and revision that the legislative process provides.It’s in a state’s interest for ballot measures to be clear, so the state tries to help. Alaska, for example, offers pretty succinct advice for making ballot measures clear: “The policy of the state is to prepare a ballot proposition that is clear, concise and easily readable.”Most states do review proposed initiatives for form and legal requirements. In some states, sponsors of initiatives can get more direct help from the pros. For instance, in Colorado legislative staff provide a mandatory review of proposed initiatives, which includes offering advice on wording and intent. Legislative staff in California, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming also can play an advisory role.  But \"advisory” is the key word. All of this seasoned advice may go unheeded either because eager-beaver sponsors aren’t willing to listen or because they prefer opaqueness for reasons of their own. When near-gibberish gets on the ballot — and it does — states have one more chance to choose clarity, and that’s in producing a guide for voters. California’s 2016 guide is over 200 pages, which is hardly light reading. On the other hand, legislative staff also help produce a quick reference guide with “a concise summary of the general meaning and effect of “yes” and “no” votes on each state measure,” per California code. After that, it’s up to the voter to read the guide and proceed carefully. "

The case has grabbed headlines because the details are unusual, but it raises a question that applies in many other situations: What’s the difference between protected speech (like online fantasies) and threats that warrant legal action?\n",
		"article_content": "When a police officer goes online to indulge his fantasies about kidnapping and cannibalizing women, it’s not just disturbing. It’s a threat to our political culture and our system of government. And as such, it’s not an isolated case.Police officers are responsible not only for stopping crime, but also for maintaining the public square: the vast forum where citizens engage in political talk freely, on the assumption that they can do so without the threat of violent reprisal. The role of police officers as guards of the public square is both legal and symbolic. Thus, when the defendant in this case used rhetoric that might lead citizens to worry about becoming targets for abduction or butchering, the effect could be catastrophic. Given the content of the fantasies, that fear might grip and silence women more than others.I say this is not an isolated case because it has become commonplace for public officials to use violent, threatening rhetoric -- usually against those who disagree with them. A few jarring examples come to mind: Sarah Palin used aggressive gun rhetoric and put a “bull’s-eye” on Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was later shot. Sharron Angle threatened “Second Amendment remedies” against Congress. Jorge Robles’s ad against his opponent featured a machine gun spelling out the words “take Linda Sanchez out of office.”Such violent language is intended to threaten and silence. Because we live in a deliberative democracy, if people flee the public square, political talk would stop, the creation of public opinion would sputter, and the gears of our vast machine of self-governance would stall.The Framers recognized that public discussion of politics was not just noise, but the key to our democracy. Without citizens engaged in all kinds of public political talk, government would be unable to learn what was important and what needed to be done. Indeed, political talk in the public square is so central to our Constitutional system that it’s right there at the top of the Bill of Rights. Violent rhetoric by public officials that targets the public, however, is a growing problem whose repressive force is all too often masked by jingoistic appeals to First Amendment rights. As such, violent rhetoric by public officials should be seen as a civic problem with legal remedies: the courts should actively intervene to stop it. Determining which categories of violent talk from public officials should fall outside the bounds of protected speech will involve some easy decisions and some hard ones. For starters, it should be illegal for public officials to threaten the public with talk of shooting, abducting or cooking citizens. To be effective, the founding American principle of a free and open public square must guide any legal steps to bar officials from using violent rhetoric to target citizens. The goal must never be to silence speech, but to protect the conditions whereby political talk can flourish. If a police officer takes to cannibal fantasies, then for the sake of his family, his community and our democratic culture, he should confine such talk to his therapist’s office. And if other public officials disagree with the opposition, they should say so – without trying to silence dissent.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate. "

Given the decidedly partisan outcome of the stimulus vote, should President Obama give up on bipartisanship in carrying out his broader agenda?\n",
		"article_content": "President Obama reached out in his campaign and in his transition to Republicans, and he said that bipartisanship in solving our problems would be a hall mark of the change he wanted to bring to America. The President’sdesire for bipartisanship is to be applauded, and it stands in sharp contrast with the behavior of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid who steamrolled over the Republicans in writingthe stimulus bill.\nI do not blame the president for Speaker Pelosi’s and Senator Reid’s behavior nor do I think it is what he wants to see repeated. We need bipartisanship in many areas, but let me mention two that especiallystand out.\nIn education, we need to move toward a system where public schools are funded out of taxes collected statewide or federally rather than through highly unequal residential property taxes. We also need many, many morecharter schools and vouchers for education. The bipartisan solution to our education problems is to reform both the way we fund public schools and the degree to which they compete.\nThe same thing applies for health care reform. We need to provide funding for private individuals who do not have and cannot afford health insurance to buy it on the private market. To do this, we need gradually toeliminate the tax deductability of employer-provided health care plans to fund health care tax credits. This will sever the current link between having a job and having health care. It will also lead to controlof health care prices because upper income consumers of health care will watch their health care expenses more carefully if they have to pay for them with after tax income rather than with before tax employer providedbenefits which are seen as being a freebie.\nOne bipartisan solution to education and health care policy is for government to, in effect, give all citizens an education or health care credit or voucher and then let them buy education or health care from the providerthey like the most. This is the essence of free-market socialism, which is what I think President Obama wants."

Some media analysts compared the format and the jokes to comfort food, familiar and safe for stressful times. NBC,in moving Mr. Leno to prime time, is betting that comedy will sell. Adam Stotsky of NBC Entertainment, said viewers want to “laughoff the problems of the day.” What does the show say about national sensibilities?\nGenerally, do styles of humor change depending on the politics of the time and unemployment figures? What makes people laugh in hard times?\n",
		"article_content": "Comedy flourishes in hard times — that’s one old saw, I’m afraid, that needs to be retired. Yes, movie audiences in the Depression flocked to screwball comedies and Astaire-Rogers musicals, butthey also filled the theaters for gritty gangster sagas and social-protest films. The economy tanked a year ago, but there’s still no sign of a comeback for the TV sitcom. One comedy genre, however, is thriving:satirical commentary on the day’s news by a multiplying crew of late-night (and now, thanks to Jay Leno, prime time) monologists.\nYet the impetus for this boom in political — or, more correctly, topical — comedy is not the Great Recession. It’s the increasingly polarized and impassioned political climate. People don’ttune into David Letterman or Jay Leno for escape, exactly. Instead, just as reality shows hold up a mirror to life’s traumatic moments (getting rejected by a boyfriend, working for a bad boss, trying to loseweight) and turn them into games or soap opera, so the TV comics rub our noses in the angst-producing news headlines, in order to convince us that nothing is worth getting too stressed about. It’s psychoanalysisby wisecrack.\nYou could see topical comedy making a comeback during the Bush II years, when even mediocre club comics started doing jokes about Dick Cheney and weapons of mass destruction. The political scene had simply gotten toooutré to ignore. Barack Obama’s election was supposed to put a damper on political comedy, but in fact it has merely shifted the emphasis. The butt of the joke is no longer a bumbling president, butthe country’s bumbling reaction to a president who (so far at least) has stubbornly refused to serve up straight lines.\nThe danger — now that Mr. Leno starts the nightly laugh track an hour and a half earlier — is that the glut of punchlines will soon make us punch-drunk. A Joe Wilson cries “You lie” on theHouse floor, and by the time a half-dozen sets of comedy writers are finished working it over, the audience may be looking for a different kind of escape. Which is why “CSI” was invented.\n"

Stocks plunged on Thursday amid heightened fears that the United States may be headed toward a double-dip recession. Today's monthly jobs report, though better than expected, is unlikely to ease those concerns. Earlier in the week, a key index reported that manufacturers recorded their weakest growth in two years in July. But is there a bright spot in the manufacturing numbers? While the growth slowed significantly, the trend is still up: output increased a small amount, and the sector has been expanding slowly but steadily for 24 consecutive months. Is it possible that manufacturing might help the U.S. economy recover and produce needed jobs?  Or is domestic manufacturing -- at least in the traditional sense -- a relic of the past,  incapable of rescuing the American labor market? \n",
		"article_content": "Manufacturers are returning to America and hiring new workers.  Last year, manufacturers created 136,000 net new jobs, the first increase since 1997. U.S. firms have good reasons to come home. One is economic. China, the primary destination of outsourced jobs, is becoming more expensive. Skilled Chinese labor is becoming scarcer. America’s labor productivity -- a key factor in determining profit -- also is among the best in the world.Another reason companies are choosing to manufacture at home is quality.Large companies may have legitimate reasons to outsource. They can take full advantage of low labor and material costs by building factories overseas. They have the resources to control product quality and the progress of production. Small and midsize firms don’t have this option. While manufacturing at home may increase the cost of production for small and medium firms, it avoids the unnecessary waste of money caused by missed deadlines and poor-quality products manufactured by their overseas partners.Moving production back to America also shortens the supply chain. We live in an era in which innovation and technological advances bring new products to market daily. Consumers’ tastes constantly are changing. This makes it crucial for manufacturers to be able to adjust production and get to market quickly. A container ship takes two weeks to travel the 6,000 miles from China to the West Coast. Clearing customs and reaching domestic outlets further slow a product’s journey. Shortening the supply chain can make a critical competitive difference, helping manufacturers monitor the progress of production and avoid delays.Last year, manufacturing contributed 12 percent of the gross domestic product in the U.S. and 9 percent of the total nonfarm employment. U.S. manufacturing output ranked first in the world, accounting for more than 20 percent of total manufacturing output worldwide. \"Made in America\" is back. While manufacturing might not be the ultimate force that fuels the economic recovery and puts America back to work, it will certainly play a major role.   "

The justices will know that ruling against the Affordable Care Act  would negate heath insurance for millions of people, and even if they reject constitutional protection for same-sex marriage thousands of such marriages have already occurred. Should real-world effects influence the thinking of Supreme Court justices in reaching decisions? \n",
		"article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts famously asserted that a justice’s role was to simply “call balls and strikes.”  However, judicial interpretation is more complicated than Roberts’s baseball analogy admits.  In many cases, constitutional and statutory text is imprecise or opaque, admitting multiple interpretations.  In such cases, judges consider many variables, including the real-world consequences of their decisions.  Brown v. Board of Education is a paradigmatic example.  There, the justices did not limit their inquiry to the scope of the 14th Amendment or the application of past precedents, like Plessy v. Ferguson.  Instead, they considered a range of things, including social science data suggesting that racial segregation had detrimental psychological effects on the black children consigned to Jim Crow’s under-resourced public schools.  In addition to these domestic concerns, the Brown court also confronted segregation’s effects on American diplomacy abroad.  In an amicus brief, the Justice Department noted that racial segregation had “an adverse effect upon our relations with other countries,” furnishing grist for Communist propaganda mills and jeopardizing the nation’s “moral leadership” around the globe.  Thus, when the court voted unanimously to overrule “separate but equal,” it knew that its decision would not only dismantle de jure segregation in the South, it would rehabilitate America’s image around the world.Of course, the consideration of a decision’s consequences does not always lead to landmark decisions like Brown.  More often, the court’s attention to real world practicalities is more prosaic.  In City of Chicago v. Morales, the court invalidated a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance aimed at reducing gang violence.  In doing so, the court focused on practical matters, including the difficulty of enforcing the ordinance.  Poorly drafted, the ordinance offered police officers little guidance for appropriate enforcement, and its imprecise terms deterred ordinary citizens from otherwise lawful conduct.  Even the dissent grappled with the practical effects of the ordinance and the court’s decision to strike it down.  Justice Antonin Scalia had no trouble with the ordinance, which he pronounced a “small price to pay” to secure Chicago’s streets.  Justice Clarence Thomas worried that the decision would sentence “law-abiding citizens to lives of terror and misery.”This term, the court will hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act and state-level bans on same-sex marriage.  The outcomes in these cases will affect the lives of millions of Americans in ways both prosaic and profound.  Because these cases involve constitutional and statutory provisions that are subject to multiple interpretations, practical considerations will, at some level, inform the court’s decision-making.  This realization may prompt claims of judicial activism.  But attention to the real-world consequences of its decisions has always played a role in the court’s work.  It is simply part of the difficult business of calling balls and strikes."

He was surprised to find few takers, especially for the back-breaking work involved in picking sweet corn. But foreign migrants have always performed hard labor in U.S. agriculture, no matter what the national unemployment rate. So when Americans complain about  the lack of jobs  today, they are drawing a line somewhere. For many people of the unemployed, it makes more sense to collect unemployment or disability or other benefits  than it does to take a temporary job  that they cannot or will not do, for whatever reason. As President Obama seeks more extensions on unemployment benefits, even  some jobless Americans are asking if providing this bigger safety net is the right, or the only, thing to do in this economy. Hard work is part of the national self-image. How has our definition of it changed? How can we describe the American work ethic today? \n\n",
		"article_content": "Any discussion of whether Americans are no longer hard-working must begin with a look at wages and benefits.   After all, the amount of effort and enthusiasm for any job is related to compensation.  If we are dealing with jobs that do not require a lot of formal schooling, the wage data speak volumes.  The Economic Policy Institute has found that real hourly wages (inflation adjusted) for men without a high school education were 22 percent lower in 2007, before the recession, than in 1979.  For those with only a high school education, they were 10 percent lower. The share getting benefits like health care has also declined.Relative to those with a college education the declines are even more profound.  What employers are offering today to young and less-educated Americans is significantly less in real terms and dramatically less in relative terms.Consider meat packing.  Cutting up dead animals is hard, unpleasant work, in dangerous conditions.  But real wages for meat packers were 45 percent lower in 2007 than in 1980.  By bringing in immigrants and moving to smaller communities, the industry, which does not face significant import competition, was able to lower wages and increase the pace of work.  Is it any wonder that meat-packing companies have trouble recruiting and retaining good workers?Even with all this, the vast majority of the difficult low-status and lower-paid jobs in America are done by people born in this country. For example in 2007, before the recession, 55 percent of maids and housekeepers were native born, as were 63 percent of butchers and meat processors, 65 percent of construction laborers and 75 percent of janitors.Every generation, especially after it turns 40, tends to feel that people worked harder in the past. There is some truth to the argument that each generation grows up with more luxury, and this affects attitudes about work.  But when we consider how much less jobs pay in many sectors of the labor market, it puts such claims into an entirely different perspective.Lowering the level of immigration, strengthening unions and raising the minimum wage would all be helpful in improving the lives of less-educated Americans — native born and legal immigrants already here.  Better compensation would go a long way in making it easier for employers to recruit and retain good workers.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate. "

New Year’s Day but not the Orthodox or lunar new year. Washington’s Birthday but not Lincoln’s.Should the U.S. have more or different official holidays?\n",
		"article_content": "In 1870, an Illinois representative introduced to the House of Representatives a bill to declare several days federal holidays. The bill's language was approved by the House and the Senate, and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in late June 1870. It included Jan. 1, July 4, Thanksgiving Day and Dec. 25 as holidays. Congress acknowledged that Jan. 1 is “commonly called New Year's Day” and Dec. 25 is “commonly called Christmas Day.” Thanksgiving, presumably, was identified by its name because its date changes from year to year.Federal holidays, it should be noted, apply to federal employees and the District of Columbia. States and cities are free to adopt federal holidays or not, just as they are free to propose and approve their own holidays.  The same is true for private employers; nothing forces them to stick to federal holidays.The suggestion that Christmas is the “only religious federal holiday” is misleading. If you read the language of the bill, it's clear that Congress chose dates commonly celebrated as holidays by the American people, not for religious reasons but because of a history of recognition and celebration on those dates. In common sense, they did not deny religious association with two of the dates, Dec. 25 and Thanksgiving. But the religious association with these days was not the reason behind proposing them as holidays.The dates proposed and approved in the bill were proposed because of common celebratory associations: the beginning of a new year, independence from British rule, the Pilgrims’ gratitude and the birth of Christ. They were approved, not because the government wished to force celebration, but because there was no reason to deny the legislation. It did not establish a government religion or say that one faith deserved recognition over another. It simply recognized that certain days in the year are commonly celebrated. Federal employees, on the whole, would greatly benefit from having these days built in as holidays.The Becket Fund is not for or against adding federal holidays. As for religious ones, it makes no difference, as long as the federal government does not mandate observance of the religious nature of a day.  At the same time, a government employee who presents a reasonable case for taking a day from work for religious observance should be accommodated, even if that day is not a state or federal holiday. A reasonable request for a personal holiday – a day on which work would make religious observance very difficult or impossible – should not be denied, especially considering that paid leave is often given for nonreligious reasons.America is a place of many faiths and traditions. To remove a holiday purely because it's commonly associated with a religious celebration is extreme and hints at hostility to religion, considering that Americans celebrate for so many other reasons. We're not required to celebrate Christmas, just as we're not required to celebrate the Fourth of July.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, made a new pledge this week to add privacy controls that are simpler to use.\nBut for lots of critics Facebook’s general opt-out approach isn’t enough. Fifteen privacy groups have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission seekingan investigation over possible deceptive trade practices. Senator Charles Schumer has urged the F.T.C. to provide guidelines for social networkingsites, like Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter on how private information submitted by online users can be used and disseminated.\nWhat can government do to ensure that users have control of their own information, which might live on indefinitely on the Web? Would regulation work? Or should government stay out of this arena?\n",
		"article_content": "Concerns about Facebook’s privacy policies have to be divided into two categories: those concerns that are really about the Internet, considered as a whole, but which currently settle on Facebook as the dominantsocial networking service, and those concerns that are genuinely about Facebook.\nThe former category is the larger of the two — in much the same way as the music industry complained about Napster or the newspaper industry about Craigslist, when the real source of change was the Internet itself.Current concerns about privacy often attach to Facebook because it is the largest holder of personally contributed but putatively private data in the world. In many cases, though, Facebook is just the technologicalavatar of the medium, rather than being a cause of any change in privacy itself.\nThere are two principal effects of the Internet on privacy. The first is to shrink personal expression to a dichotomy: public or private. Prior to the rise of digital social life, much of what we said and did was ina public environment — on the street, in a park, at a party — but was not actually public, in the sense of being widely broadcast or persistently available.\nThis enormous swath of personal life, as we used to call it, existed on a spectrum between public and private, and the sheer inconvenience of collecting and collating theoretically observable but practicallyunobserved actions was enough to keep those actions out of the public sphere.\nThat spectrum has now collapsed — data is either public or private, and the idea of personal utterances being observable but unobserved is becoming as quaint as an ice cream social.\nIn addition to the spectrum of disclosure collapsing to the binary choice of public vs. private, the cost of privacy has also reversed. Pre-Internet, making something public took and enormous amount of timeand effort, so much, in fact, that public expression was out of the reach of most citizens.\nNow, that cost structure has been turned upside-down: there are any number of services that will help you make any information you want publicly available for free; it is keeping things private that requireseffort.\nFacebook, by virtue of building the largest social environment on the Internet, can have the biggest effect on personal privacy simply because it holds data on the largest number of persons. The privacy questionFacebook faces is this: how much does it want to push toward or defend against the Internet’s effect on personal space?\nFor the first several years of Facebook’s existence, its management of the “social graph” (the sum total of all users, expressed as a collection of linked profiles) provided some breathingroom for personal life, by enabling sharing among groups of friends, without making the data completely public.\nThat ability of Facebook users to limit sharing, however imperfectly, to friends and friends of friends, kept intact some measure of the old offline inefficiencies, even as social life increasingly migratedonline.\nUnfortunately, Facebook’s business model is in increasing tension with this inefficiency. The more sharing, the better calculated in page views, and in data collected on users’ behavior. Becausethe Internet, in its native form, makes it easier and cheaper to create and disseminate data in public than to keep it in confidence, Facebook willalways be pushed in the direction of leadingits users into a world of more sharing.\nEvery such move will upset a few users, of course, but as long as they introduce new pushes towards more such sharing incrementally, as long as they add controls that allow the minority of upset users to optout, there is no obvious reason that they won’t be able to maximize erosion of the personal sphere for years to come, while increasing both the size of their market, and their value to advertisers.\n"

Hruska said, \"Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they, and a little chance?\" Hruska came to mind as I watched the cringeworthy and seemingly interminable performance of Herman Cain trying to answer a simple and straightforward question about policy toward Libya, one that didn't rise to the standard of mediocre. But Cain's answer was actually light years better than one given during the 2010 campaign by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer -- not an answer to a question posed to her, but a predesignated minute for an opening statement in a debate, in which she could not fill 30 seconds.It may give comfort to Cain that Brewer's embarrassing failure did not deter Arizona voters from keeping her in office (where she is on a roll to show that mediocrity goes well with extremism; she just impeached an upstanding Arizona citizen who chaired the state's independent redistricting commission because she didn't like the results). But it is not as if voters were taken by surprise; her lack of intellect and right-wing views were fully on display during the campaign.\n \nAnd that is what makes elections and elected officials different from civil servants. Campaigns are like extended job interviews; at least for those running for visible, higher offices, the combination of debates, journalists' questions, opposition advertising and the pressure that comes with campaigning give a pretty good window into the qualities, including basic knowledge, that candidates have. And voters can judge whether those qualities, which may include limited intellect, limited intellectual curiosity, or basic ignorance, outweigh other things -- which may include simply wanting to throw the other rascals out.\n \nI am generally content with this balance, but with two giant caveats. The first is that the choice of candidates is not any longer in the hands of the larger mass of voters, but in those of the ideological activists who dominate primaries and caucuses. So we are getting more extreme candidates opposing each other in general elections. It is as if the civil service jobs could only be filled by a narrow range of people largely unqualified temperamentally or experience-wise for the jobs.  Second, the campaigns we face in the future, thanks in considerable measure to the reckless and destructive Citizens United decision of the Supreme Court and the fecklessness of the Federal Election Commission, will make it harder for voters to judge the qualities and knowledge of candidates. Huge money buys from outside groups and candidates' \"super PACs\" will enable mediocrities to avoid any scrutiny, running campaigns based on ads, and with outside attack ads defining candidates before they can define themselves. We don't need written competency tests, but we do need a better way to expand the candidate pool and return campaigns to what they should be, a chance to examine candidates unfiltered, up close and personal.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

The U.S. and the Friends of Syria should work with the government of Turkey to immediately establish safe zones, a possibility Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has been considering. If the U.S. is reticent to act in a way that is seen as imposing and unilateral, then it could at least support and encourage the initiatives put forth by the Friends of Syria. If the Friends of Syria come to a decision this weekend, it could provide cover for the U.S. and the entire international movement of those opposed to Assad to act more decisively. Subsequently, this renewed international pressure could push the Turkish government to implement safe zones and areas of protection inside Syria along the border with Turkey. Revolutionaries including the Free Syria Army have called repeatedly for the establishment of such safe zones.

Are governments hiding evidence that aliens have visited earth?Conspiracy theories are often seen as laughable, and the people who believe them are considered paranoid but usually harmless individuals.But while many conspiracy theories may indeed be harmless, recent psychological research suggests that some of the social consequences of conspiracy theories deserve more serious attention.My colleague Daniel Jolley and I found, for example, that people who were exposed to anti-government conspiracy theories were less likely to want to vote than those who had read information refuting conspiracy theories. In a similar study, we found that people who read about climate change conspiracy theories (versus those who read anti-conspiracy material and those who read no material about climate change) expressed less intention to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. In another investigation, we found that reading about anti-vaccine conspiracy theories reduced people’s intentions to vaccinate, compared with those who viewed arguments refuting conspiracy theories, or those who read no material about vaccination. In each case, conspiracy theories decreased social engagement because they left people feeling powerless, and there is also some evidence that conspiracy theories might influence people without them knowing it.Some level of healthy skepticism is undoubtedly important for individuals, and citizens cannot be expected to agree with everything they are told. Some conspiracy theories may even be useful in allowing people to question social hierarchies and discover new information for examination and discussion. But many conspiracy theories seem to be dangerously subversive, undermining people’s confidence in established positions on topics such as climate change and vaccination. They appear to threaten the social systems that people rely upon and encourage inaction where it cannot be afforded.

But at many prisons, family visitation is increasingly difficult and even phone calls are exorbitantly expensive.Some prisons have instituted “video visitation” as a solution. Does that help or create new problems?\n",
		"article_content": "At the jail here in Polk County, Iowa, we began using a remote visitation system last fall to allow family members to see inmates without taking a day off work or driving long distances. The approach has had several benefits.The biggest benefit I see is that it minimizes or eliminates the need for children of inmates to be exposed to a jail setting. Video visitation allows children to maintain a connection with an incarcerated parent from their homes, where they feel more relaxed and are not intimidated by their surroundings. Additionally, if one parent has been incarcerated, it can create a travel burden on the remaining parent – who is often trying to maintain a work schedule, care for children and make time to travel to the jail. Especially in the winter, if we can avoid making someone drive a long distance, that’s a win for everybody.Video visitations also require less staff supervision and coordination. This is a major factor when many government budgets are tight. Because video visitation does not require the assistance of staff to connect, visitation hours can go well after the normal in-person hours. This, in turn, keeps the inmates more connected with family members. Studies show that when inmates are more connected to family members on the outside, they create fewer problems on the inside.The biggest downside to the video visitation system is the initial cost, although in Polk County that is being paid over time through modest fees: each 30-minute session with family costs $11.

		"instruction": "Headline: Baltimore and Bolstering a Police Officers’ Right to Remain Silent\nInstructions: Many in Baltimore are enraged not just by the death of Freddie Gray in police custody but by the mystery that surrounds his death after a ride in a police van. This mystery exists because the officers who could say what happened are protected by a Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, which limits and delays questioning police about potential misconduct. The idea behind such laws in 14 states, and similar contractual rights in some jurisdictions, is that no one should be forced to speak to investigators and possibly incriminate themselves.Do such measures protect the constitutional rights of police, or do they unnecessarily impede investigations of possible wrongdoing?\n",
		"article_content": "When I was a prosecutor, nothing made a police officer angrier than being treated like a suspect.  If we prosecutors asked the officer too many questions about how he obtained evidence or if we questioned his credibility in any way, he would catch an attitude.  “Don’t treat me like a suspect” communicated that officer’s belief that he didn’t have to follow the same rules as the citizens he serves and protects.   The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights makes that double standard the law in 14 states.Here is one of the many reasons that the city of Baltimore erupted in flames this week.  When police officers first encountered Freddie Gray he was alive and walking.  After a week in their custody, he was dead with a severed spine and a crushed voice box.  And the mayor and the police chief say they have no idea how that happened.  Say that the police suspect a civilian of a horrible crime, like killing a man by breaking his spine.   Within the crucial first 24 hours after the crime, the cops would put the man in a room, read him his Miranda warnings and then go to work.  They would try to get him to talk, perhaps by lying to him, or threatening him, or by wearing him down.  Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. But any cop worth her salt would try because, hell, it’s homicide investigation.  Unless, thanks to the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, it’s a homicide investigation of a police officer.  Lucky for them, those cops don’t get treated like some suspect.  Among other things, they get 10 days before they have to say a mumbling word.It is far from a fanciful concern that the police will take advantage of all the extra due process they get under Maryland law to concoct an alternative version of events.  Indeed, in the Freddie Gray case, they have already done so.  The police report filed the day Gray was  arrested states that he was taken into custody “without force of incident.”  That is a big lie, the cell phone videos of the arrest subsequently revealed.  It will be interesting to see what else got added to the story in the nine other days before those police officers were required to talk to investigators.It’s strange that a law that thwarts transparency and accountability is called a “bill of rights.”  The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights has the same relationship to a real bill of rights that the Patriot Act has to a real patriot.  The real Bill of Rights — the one enshrined in the United States Constitution — actually limits the power of government, including the police.  When I heard President Obama use the word “thugs” in talking about the situation in Baltimore, I did not know if he meant the people participating in the urban insurrection or the police who arrested Freddie Grey.  Here is what I do know: In a democracy an accused “thug” should not get more rights just because he wears a badge and a gun.  "

		"instruction": "Headline: A Fatal Blow to Obama’s Health Care Law?\nInstructions: A federal district judge in Richmond, Va., ruled on Monday that the new health care law's provision requiring individuals to buy health insurance is unconstitutional. Judge Henry E. Hudson  wrote that the requirement goes beyond Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.Judge Hudson is the first jurist to in the country to invalidate part of the law, ensuring that the issue will reach the appellate courts. Two other federal judges — in Detroit and Lynchburg, Va. — have upheld the insurance mandate.What arguments are convincing -- or problematic -- in Judge Hudson's decision? And how might this ruling affect the politics surrounding the law?\n\n",
		"article_content": "The days of calling the constitutional challenges to the Affordable Care Act “frivolous” and “political” are now officially over.  Judge  Hudson’s ruling that the individual insurance mandate is unconstitutional is a milestone in the legal process of deciding whether Congress has the power to command every person in the United States to enter into an economic relationship with a private company. Until 2010, the only mandates ever imposed on American citizens pertained to their citizenship: register for the draft and serve if called, sit on a jury, file a tax return, respond to the census. In the U.S., one cannot even be commanded to vote. If economic mandates like this one are allowed, however, Americans will be demoted from citizens to subjects. They will have to obey any commands that Congress deems convenient to its regulation of interstate commerce. No more expensive tax credits and subsidies to raise taxes to pay for; Congress can just command you to buy its favored products. Forget cash for clunkers; just make Americans buy cars from G.M. Or make them undergo medical exams to save on health care costs. Gone will be a federal government of limited and enumerated powers established by the Constitution and repeatedly affirmed by the Supreme Court.In his ruling today, Judge Hudson recognized that such an unprecedented claim of power had never been sanctioned by the Supreme Court. Even Judge Steeh, the district court judge in Michigan who upheld the mandate in October, said this “arguably presents an issue of first impression.” True, today’s decision is just a single ruling by one judge. But had it gone the other way, cries that such challenges were frivolous and political would again have been heard from pundits, professors, and politicians. So today’s ruling is big, both legally and atmospherically.On Thursday morning, the spotlight moves to Pensacola, Fla.  where oral arguments on the challenge brought against the law by 20  attorneys general will be heard. Like Judge Hudson today, Federal District Court Judge Roger Vinson has already dismissed the government’s invocation of its tax power on the merits, while signaling his skepticism about the government’s Commerce Clause theory. If he now joins in striking down the individual mandate, I would not be surprised to see the next Congress and  President Obama agree to “reform” the law  by eliminating this constitutionally noxious mandate before the Supreme Court ever has a chance to rule. \n"

Is that changing? Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said on Tuesday that justices shouldn't have to attend the State of the Union; at the last one,  Justice Samuel Alito shook his head and mouthed the words \"not true\" when President Barack Obama criticized the court for its campaign finance decision. Spousal behavior has come under the spotlight, too. Virginia Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, has been scrutinized for soliciting donations to Liberty Central, an organization she founded to oppose the Democrats, and for leaving a voice mail message seeking an apology from Anita Hill, who accused Justice Thomas of sexual harassment during his confirmation hearings in 1991.\n \nShould Supreme Court justices, and perhaps their spouses, have to show greater decorum and neutrality than other political actors? Or would the public benefit from their being more transparent about their views?  How did this tension play out in earlier eras? \n",
		"article_content": "To maintain respect and credibility, the Supreme Court justices must avoid real or potential conflicts of interest and, as much as possible, avoid overt political controversy.With these principles in mind, I think Supreme Court justices need to make a choice about the State of the Union address: either don’t go at all, or accept the awkward role of having to sit in the House chamber without showing emotion or reaction. The State of the Union address has become a highly political moment, but it does allow the three branches to come together to hear the president’s report on the nation’s well-being. And in some small way it is reassuring to see justices in the chamber, though the republic will not suffer terribly if they don’t attend. In the interest of decorum, perhaps it is not too much to ask that a president find other occasions to criticize the court and that justices accept the role of sitting on their hands. Concerns about how the justices are perceived is not new. Justice William Brennan,  who was on the court from 1956 to 1990, for example,  worried so greatly about the reputation of the court that, when hints of a financial scandal in 1969 led to the resignation of Justice Abe Fortas, he withdrew from all public activities and investments. This may have been an over-reaction but reflects the concern held by some justices throughout the court's history.Issues surrounding the activities of justices' spouses are perhaps more recent. Spouses are certainly entitled to pursue their own careers and interests, but their activities can have an impact on the justices. In my view, at a minimum there has to be disclosure of activities that may pose a potential conflict, especially because the question of when a justice should step aside in a case is more or less left to his or her own discretion. It would be helpful to know what issues Justice Thomas’s wife, Virginia, is involved in or what sources of financial support for her organization may pose a potential problem for Justice Thomas. If he gets to decide when to recuse himself, wouldn’t the public interest be better served by disclosing the circumstances of potential conflicts of interest? There may be no real conflict, but greater openness would help establish that point.\n"

A recent survey seems to come down on the side of makeup—at least superficially—saying that wearing makeup increases a woman’s likability and competence in the workplace.If makeup has indeed become the status quo in the public realm, does it ultimately damage a woman’s self-esteem, or elevate it? \n\n",
		"article_content": "Makeup, like beauty, may be only skin deep, but  that’s plenty deep enough to confer some unsettling advantages. A recent study sponsored by Proctor and Gamble found that makeup boosts perceptions of women’s likeability and competence, as well as attractiveness. But how much, at what cost, and in what contexts  were questions discretely overlooked. As a law professor of a certain age, I should confess at the outset that I rarely use makeup.  I doubt that my students much notice, let alone care, whether I’m wearing mascara.  And as a matter of principle, I’d prefer that they didn’t.My reasons are set forth at length in my book, \"The Beauty Bias,\" which reviews the costs of  discrimination based on appearance.  The price is paid not only in dollars, although that is of itself substantial.  Our global investment in makeup totals over $18 billion, and much of it is spent on expensive products that many dermatologists label  as “cosmetic hoo haw.”  The more serious injustices arise when women lose jobs and self-esteem based on a failure to conform to our culture’s airbrushed ideals of female attractiveness.Makeup is a minor part of the problem.  But there are symbolic stakes in cases like Jesperson v. Harrah’s Casino, in which a female bartender was fired for refusing to comply with the casino’s requirements that she wear makeup  and have her hair teased, curled, or styled.  She felt that being “dolled up” diminished her authority, and her performance evaluations had been excellent without cosmetic assistance. Male bartenders were subject to no such elaborate appearance requirements. As a judge noted, their “undoctored“  faces were good enough.If makeup enhances women’s  self- confidence, they should by all means wear it. But it should be a choice, not a requirement imposed on employees where it is not essential to job performance. The world would be a better place if women were judged more on  competence and less on appearance.  Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate. "

Should the United States throw in with this approach if it’s unlikelythat Congress will approve any greenhouse gas reduction plan?\n",

Nowhere is this more clear thanin the discussion over climate change mitigation and adaptation aid from developed countries to developing countries, which may yet be the death of the Copenhagen talks.\nIndustrial countries have expressed willingness to put $10 billion a year of “fast start” money on the table. Gordon Brown recently said that Britain is willing to contribute as much as $3 billion a yearif other developed countries make commensurate pledges, which could push the total higher, perhaps even up to $20 billion.\nMeanwhile, developing countries want financing on the order of $100 billion a year. The World Bank projects they’ll need $400 billion a year. But they don’t want the fund administered by the WorldBank, which they don’t trust. They want it dispersed by a newly created institution. And they don’t want any strings attached regarding mandatory emission reductions on their part.\nNow, putting aside moral or economic arguments about whether this level of aid is justified, the idea that the world’s richest countries are going to dump $100 billion on the world’s developingnations — including China, their fastest-growing competitor! — without any strings attached is, well, fantastical. It just won’t happen.\nThat’s where we are now. China, Brazil and the rest of the Group of 77 are making it very clear that they’re not seeing enough from rich nations. Rich nations are making it very clear that they’renot seeing enough from the G-77. And both sides seem unwilling to do anything but fiddle around the margins.\nWould a U.S. pledge to match the European Union’s $3 billion a year a) bridge this enormous political gap between developed and developing countries and b) pass muster in the U.S. Senate?

Given this turn of events — and the West’s longstanding alliance with the House of Saud — is Saudi Arabia a trustworthy ally? \n\n",
		"article_content": "Despite many, obvious shared interests, Saudi Arabia is no longer a reliable ally for the United States. True, Saudi Arabia has recently helped keep oil prices down, and this helps weaken the economies of both Russia and Iran. The kingdom and the U.S. agree that Bashar al-Assad should not continue as president of Syria; and they both support President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt — the U.S. despite Sisi's autocratic tendencies, Saudi Arabia because of them. Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia are status quo powers in the Persian Gulf, and the Saudis support and facilitate the American military presence in that region.But the Saudi execution last week of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a prominent opposition Shiite cleric in Saudi Arabia who was not a threat to the kingdom and whose killing offended the Iranians, was an act that served only to undermine international efforts to resolve conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Yes, executions of political or religious dissenters take place in Saudi Arabia, but this, along with the Saudi encouragement and financing of radical, even violent, Islamic extremism is a threat not only to the U.S. but to stability everywhere. It is understandable that a more self-confident Saudi Arabia has been increasingly assertive in the region. But it has not proved itself capable of exercising power wisely, as shown by its costly entanglement and heedless bombing of civilian targets in the Yemen civil war. While other countries, notably Iran,  probably bear more responsibility than Saudi Arabia, the kingdom has added fuel to the disastrous Sunni-Shiite sectarianism among Muslims in the Middle East.Yet it remains the case that Saudi Arabia's security depends on the United States. This gives  Washington leverage in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia may yet be persuaded to end encouragement of a fundamentalist form  of Islam that, in the end, poses a threat to the kingdom itself; to allow for greater political and religious freedom inside the kingdom; to heal the growing Sunni-Shiite breach; and to exercise its regional power more wisely. This is leverage the U.S. should  not hesitate to use."

While this data is worth noting and signals a need for policymakers and advocates to reexamine our family-centered policies, we shouldn’t present single motherhood as a problem in itself.\nInstead we need to take this opportunity to call for greater economic support, health care access and education for all women, so that those wishing to be mothers can raise healthy and happy children, with or withoutthe support of a spouse. Specifically we must remember that women still get paid less than men do for the same work and that women who are insured pay higher insurance premiums for health care coverage than mendo. Both of these issues put single working mothers at a lower socio-economic status than women in two income households.\nBut this data must also be carefully scrutinized. Recent migration patterns show that women from Latin America are coming to the United States and assuming head of household responsibilities. These women may be livingwith a partner but may not be legally married by U.S. law and are therefore listed in the study as “unmarried.”\nMoreover, for many Latino families, a household may not look like a traditional husband and wife scenario. Indeed, in many Latino households, grandmothers, aunts and uncles play a significant role in raising childrenand contributing to the household income. Finally, the data that links single-motherhood to lower achievement for their children is weak and dubious. And frankly, it’s always dangerous to assume women wouldbe better off with their husbands.\nWe have to contextualize the data and not jump to policy conclusions that can further penalize unwed mothers.

The move sets up a legal showdown between Apple — which says it does not possess the technology to open the phone and will not create it because it would threaten the privacy of its customers — and the law enforcement authorities, who say that new encryption technologies hamper their ability to prevent and solve crime.Should companies have to unlock encrypted communication in the case of a crime?\n",

If a company is served with a lawful order to assist with an ongoing criminal investigation and it is possible for that company to assist, it has to comply. Apple was served a warrant.

If this is true, they are off the hook, but if they can build the technology to comply (or already have), they need do what the warrant asks.Nobody is asking for backdoor entry into Americans' phones: That’s a fiction invented to skew the debate. What the U.S. and many other countries are asking for is lawful access to communications when authorized by a court. This is the real encryption debate: What are the rules under which a government can open an encrypted iPhone or similar device, and access its messages in plaintext? Intelligence agencies in the U.S. and elsewhere can usually find a way to get access to plaintext, or unencrypted text, without cooperation from companies, but the data they get may not be introducible in court, at least in democracies.  Apple needs to make the case to its global market that they don’t turn over data whenever the F.B.I. strolls through the door. That’s understandable. The U.S. also needs to help tech companies reassure a global market about surveillance in order to reassure customers.But there are plenty of instances when it's appropriate for encrypted products to be opened to law enforcement, and the investigation into the San Bernardino killers is a prime example.The best case scenario for cooperation between tech companies and governments would be an international agreement that lets people secure their data with the strongest possible encryption, using products that allow for the lawful recovery of plaintext by their governing national authorities under agreed-upon rules. The precedent to build on is the system of mutual legal assistance treaties that allow countries to exchange evidence and information for crimes like money laundering.If countries can agree on reciprocal rules on accessing plaintext, we can get out of the encryption mess.

It became a “choice” for needy members of the aggressively recruited lower middle class and a generational “duty” for the legacy recruits from upper-middle-class military families. In this environment, it is inevitable that military families will ask: Why should I, or my child, die for rich people who never served and won’t send their children to serve?There is a symbiotic relationship between the “leave it to us professionals” attitude expressed by our military leaders — who now command what amounts to a mercenary force wrapped in the flag, when compared with the citizen army our founders envisioned — and the “not with my child” selfishness of our upper classes.For many service members, the truth is that while everyone is ready to “thank them,” few are ready to join them.

Even now as the recession lingers in the U.S. and parts of Europe, India's economy is growing at an impressive 9 percent this year.  Although there are vast differences between the two economies, what can the U.S. learn from India in terms of economic competitiveness? Which Indian policies or institutions offer some interesting lessons? \n",
		"article_content": "Many economists now believe that, by 2015, India will start outpacing China’s annual G.D.P. growth rate of 8.5 to 9.5 percent.  A number of trends in India lead to this conclusion, including a young, increasingly educated labor force, relatively few retired people to care for, the  structural reforms the Indian government continues to undertake, and increased infrastructure spending. But there is one striking factor the United States could learn from as it emerges from its own recession: Indians save approximately 33 to 36 percent  of their total G.D.P., compared with approximately 11 to 13 percent  of G.D.P. for the United States. (The Chinese save a whopping 51 percent.) Why does this matter? Although consumer spending can help an economy emerge from recession in the short run, for long-term prosperity, a higher savings rate is helpful. More money saved in U.S. banks means more money available for investment, which then leads to higher growth. There are good reasons that Indians save more than Americans: India has no safety net, no unemployment insurance, no real medical insurance, no Social Security. In Western countries, some safety nets exist, thus decreasing the incentive to save. Nevertheless, Americans have lots of reasons to start saving now. We have lost huge amounts of wealth in the stock market in the past few years, and many people, especially baby boomers ready for retirement, are over-leveraged. Social Security payments already exceed inflows, threatening its future. Large U.S. government deficits will likely lead to higher taxes in the future. For these reasons, India’s high savings and investment rates may be worth emulating. "

The Federal Reserve is not lending dollars to domestic banks that are regulated and supervised in the United States against U.S. dollar collateral. The Fed has been forced by circumstance to lend dollars on an unsecured and unlimited basis to foreign central banks against foreign currency collateral -- and without any explicit Congressional approval.

At the beginning of this month, I noted that “all indications are that Europe is already in a double-dip recession.”  I warned that that the real economy would become decidedly worse if the wholesale lending run in the European banking sector continued. I pointed to the unfolding events as tantamount to the deflationary spiral precipitated by the failure of Austrian bank Credit Anstalt in 1931, which created the Great Depression. Make no mistake, this is the path we are still on.European policy makers need to wake up. Unless European governments quickly agree to the kind of fiscal integration that gives the European Central Bank political cover to backstop the debt of euro zone national governments, which euro area banks use as collateral, European bank failures will begin in earnest and another Great Depression will be upon us.

States used to deport their own citizens if they caused too much trouble. Now we see it as a violation of human rights to force someone to leave his or her home country. It should be the same for long settled immigrants. When immigrants move to a new country and live there for a long time, it becomes their home, and they should not be forced to leave it. One of the worst things about current deportation policies is that they give almost no weight to the connections that an immigrant has here. Over time immigrants sink deep roots. They become members of society and that membership matters morally. They get an education, find jobs, pay taxes, establish families, and make friends. Their lives become bound up with the place where they live, and it is wrong to take that away from them, even when they behave badly. These arguments are more relevant to the wider debate that Justin Bieber’s arrest has provoked than to Bieber himself.

Membership claims grow over time, and so recent arrivals do not have as strong claims to stay as those who have been living there a long time. On the other hand, the crimes of which Bieber is accused are legally defined as minor ones (misdemeanors) not major ones (felonies), so it is not clear why anyone would be so keen to kick him out. He deserves no special favors but no special penalties, either, regardless of what one thinks of his music. "

Scandal Prove That 501(c)(4)’s Should Be Eliminated?\nInstructions: The Internal Revenue Service has been harshly criticized for singling out conservative organizations when it investigated which groups were legitimately applying for 501(c)(4) status, which makes them tax exempt, keeps donors confidential and allows some political activity. But should the 501(c)(4) status even exist? Should nonprofits be allowed any political activity?  \n\n",
		"article_content": "The best solution to the problems with 501(c)(4) organizations is to eliminate them completely.  The problem with the (c)(4) designation is that it is essentially a charity that is permitted to engage in unlimited lobbying and some significant amount of political campaign activity (as long as that activity isn’t the organization’s “primary purpose”) in exchange for denying the organization the ability to receive deductible charitable contributions.  But the Internal Revenue Service will never be able to satisfactorily police the line at which political activity becomes “primary.\" Since “issue advocacy” (for example, lobbying) is permitted in any amount, the problem isn’t just one of identifying when political campaign activity becomes primary; it is also identifying the line between permissible issue advocacy and political campaign activity.  This line is hard enough to enforce in the 501(c)(3) context, where political campaign activity is absolutely prohibited and lobbying permitted only to an “insubstantial” degree. The loosening of these restrictions in the (c)(4) context virtually invites wholesale noncompliance, which is pretty much what we have. \n \nFurther, the (c)(4) designation has no real purpose.  The best explanation, in my view, for tax exemption for charities is that it is a sort of partial government subsidy for organizations that offer services that the private market will not offer, and that government either will not or cannot offer directly.  I find it hard to believe that lobbying suffers from such a serious market failure that we need to subsidize organizations whose primary activity is to lobby.   In fact, it seems almost perverse that the government would subsidize organizations whose primary purpose is to lobby the government.  So let’s make it simple: if you want to be a charity, be a charity and live with the 501(c)(3) limits; if you want primarily to be engaged in the political process through lobbying or otherwise, pay taxes like everyone else or register as a 527 political organization.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

What is the tipping point for networks in tolerating bad public behavior from their big stars? In the case of Charlie Sheen, why did it take insulting his boss for executives to say \"enough\"? Has television programming itself -- particularly reality TV, which seems to condone shameless behavior --  influenced how the industry handles actors?\n",

Interestingly, Howard Beale’s tirades are rooted in existential despair, while Charlie Sheen seems entirely preoccupied with, well, Charlie Sheen.Without any inside knowledge, it’s fair to assume that Mr. Sheen was retained amid myriad shenanigans because he was making money for the studio. Had his personal life significantly damaged with the revenue stream I imagine that the executives in charge would have dispatched with him sooner.  As it is, it seems that the radio comments achieved this end only indirectly — by smearing Chuck Lorre he aggravated an independently powerful talent with substantial leverage of his own.  (Specifically, two other highly rated, Sheen-less sitcoms.)If there are any parallels to be drawn between the current Charlie Sheen flap and the loutish spirit of reality TV, it is not in the slippery mores of television executives (after all, they’re in it for the money), but Mr. Sheen’s impassioned narcissism.  At no point in the radio interview does Mr. Sheen suggest that he feels stifled or disillusioned.  Rather, in the style of the Housewives and the Kardashians, he is preoccupied with his personal mythology independent of his vocation.Certainly, there’s nothing new to “bad behavior” or, for that matter, narcissism.  (See: Narcisuss.)  He does, however, offer a juicy 21st century twist on the “mad as hell” archetype.

And does this deprive U.S. citizens of their constitutionally protected due process rights?\n",
		"article_content": "Comments on the Department of Justice \"white paper\" have yet to focus on a critical issue: the assumption that the use of military force is lawful beyond “active hostilities” or “traditional battlefields.”  About a third of the paper attempts to defend this assumption.  The remainder presents a mash-up of criminal law and law of armed conflict principles keying off the battlefield assumption.The paper presents two contradictory arguments: that the U.S. is already in a global armed conflict because of the right to use force in national self defense on 9/11, and that targeting suspected terrorists is premised on planning new attacks that trigger the right of self defense.  Presumably, the reason for the contradictory claims is because even within an armed conflict, the U.S. simply does not have evidence sufficient to target the thousands of people who have been killed by drone attacks.  The paper slips to a secondary argument, picking up some deficient assertions on the law of self defense to obscure the problem with the global war on terror assessment.Under United Nations Charter Article 51 (which is cited in the white paper), a state may resort to military force on the territory of another state if a significant armed attack occurs for which the state being attacked is responsible when the military force in self defense is necessary and the cost of military action is not excessive.  These criteria were arguably met respecting the war in Afghanistan until December 2001, when Kabul fell.  That is when the right ended.  No other plot or plan hinted at in the paper even comes close to creating a right of self defense.The U.S. is engaged in hostilities in Afghanistan only, and, therefore, has a right to launch missiles solely in that country.

Competing in the Olympic Games had been a dream of mine from the beginning, but being one of six children, skating was not the most important aspect of my – or my family’s – life. My parents were not willing to separate me from my family or take me out of my local public school to accomplish my dreams. If I was going to make it in skating, I was going to do it by being a functional family member and following the same rules as my brothers and sisters. And this suited me just fine – one house, one school, one community, one rink provided a very stable and productive environment.When I was 12 years old, my mother was hospitalized with breast cancer. I was on the way to making my first national team. The thrill of seeing my excitement at each stage of qualifying gave her strength through many rounds of chemotherapy. On days she was too weak to walk down the hospital corridor, she would think, “I have to make it through. I have to be there for my kids.” My mom was able to leave the hospital to come to Philadelphia from New York to watch me win the Junior Ladies title. That day I was skating for more than just the judges. \n\t\nThe stability instilled in my life by my parents made all the difference when I performed in Salt Lake City on skating’s grandest stage. When I stood atop the Olympic podium five months after 9/11 – in my home country – I was able to share more than just my skating experience with the same people who were with me all along. My younger sister, Emily, who competed in the 2006 Olympic Games, was raised in the same stable, supportive environment. We are among the lucky ones whose journeys are family affairs.It is no surprise to me that the comment heard most this week in interviews with our Olympic athletes in London, whether medal winners or not, is that their greatest joy comes from sharing the experience with their parents and loved ones.

Some of these trainers have been cited for multiple and serious drug violations; indeed, some havebeen barred and suspended from the sport for periods of time. But none of these punishments have deterred trainers from doping their animals.\nWhat should horse racing officials in the U.S. do to prevent this kind of abuse of horses? And what should be the penalties?\n",
		"article_content": "Horse racing and horse welfare in America are regulated by dozens of state and national associations and bureaus that aim to oversee everything from performance medications to track-safety standards, jockey welfareand the integrity of the gambling industry itself. Every state with a racetrack has its own racing commission and sets its own regulations, some of which are consistent across the industry. Some of these organizationshave the power to effect change, and do; others are feel-good nonprofits that lack the support to make a substantial impact.\nHerein lies the problem: The racing industry as a whole needs to come together for the welfare of every aspect of the sport. What we need is a single, national organization, one with the authority to standardize regulationsand the fearlessness to enforce its rules by levying substantial penalties.\nAn example of one critical issue this body must address is the seeming hypocrisy that medications that are legal in the barn and during training are banned on race day. Trainers naturally take chances that thedrugs will be flushed from the horse’s blood before the starting gate swings open. When it can be proved that a horse has been doped just before a race, the punishment needs to be a significant fine,a substantial racing ban and a prohibition against shifting the stable to an assistant trainer.\nState-to-state standardization of such regulations is the only way the industry can ever hope to eradicate such corruption. And a trainer banned from U.S. racing should automatically be banned in the same yearfrom Breeders’ Cup and other international racing competitions.\nFinally, especially during the sport’s biggest race events, industry promoters can and must do much more to keep issues of abuse and injustice in the spotlight — on television, simulcast and Internetscreens alike. Educating race fans will go a long way to bringing changes in support of horse welfare throughout the sport.\n"

		"article_content": "It will be difficult for the U.S. to continue to recover from the Great Recession without a turnaround in home sales. After all, this is the first postwar recovery that hasn’t been led by a pickup in housing. But a recovery is possible without the sector’s help. The lack of a housing rebound, by itself, would not push the economy back into a recession. The sector’s share of the overall economy has been slashed over the past few years and, at 2.4 percent during the first half of 2010, is the smallest proportion ever. So its ability to cripple the economy by itself has lessened. One can also point to the steady decline in unsold inventories of new homes as a good sign  suggesting that at some point, new construction will have to kick in, although not until there is sufficient demand. Recently, there appears to be some demand being sparked by record low mortgage rates. Mortgage applications for purchase have risen in four of the past five weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers' Associations. In other words, low rates are not just causing homeowners to refinance their mortgages, but they are enticing some buying activity as well.Nonetheless, at the end of the day, mortgage rates at record lows are not adequate to entice enough potential buyers on a sustainable basis. The most important factor remains the job market. Without a job, or without steady income, mortgage payments cannot be made, no matter how low the rate."

Is this a good idea? Rose Cuison Villazor, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, suggested this discussion.\n",
		"article_content": "The New York Is Home Act, which would grant about three million noncitizens living in New York a broad range of rights, like voting in state and local elections and the ability to serve on juries,  is a flawed bill. Unprecedented in its scope of granting rights normally reserved to citizens to all noncitizens, including those lacking a lawful immigration status, the bill only requires three years as a tax-paying resident of New York State.  The bill is defective for several reasons.  First, by extending the franchise to all noncitizens living in New York,  it would cheapen citizenship.  As a matter of strong public policy, we should want to encourage more persons to become lawful permanent residents by making it easier to qualify for this status.  And once these residents have achieved several years in that status, we should encourage more to naturalize as U.S. citizens.  After all,  naturalization should be a meaningful act.  Federal law requires persons seeking to be naturalized to be attached to the principles of the Constitution, to demonstrate  knowledge of U.S. history and government, and to swear an oath of allegiance to the United States.  These requirements encourage the concept of an informed citizenry who will take its responsibilities to vote and perform jury duty seriously. It’s true that for much of the 19th and the early part of the 20th centuries some states and local governments allowed for voting by noncitizens in state and local elections.  But it has been almost 90 years since the last state allowed for such practices. And in none of those states was the franchise or jury service extended to persons without any lawful status. The New York bill would destroy any distinction between lawful and unauthorized immigrants and treat both on the same footing — as U.S. citizens.This leads me to the second reason why the bill is a bad idea – it would strengthen the hand of immigration restrictionists. They would seize on it to attack more modest approaches to grant rights for undocumented people at the state and local levels.  Most immigration advocates, including me, want to see a broad legalization that would permit the millions already living, working and raising families in the country to gain a lawful status here.  But we don’t advance that cause by pretending that legalities don’t matter, and that someone should be rewarded with the rights to vote and serve on juries merely because they have been present for a certain number of years. Rather, we set back the cause of comprehensive immigration reform with this clumsy approach."

In today’s world, the custom seems antiquated. What wedding traditions should be revived or discarded?\n",
		"article_content": "When someone hosts a wedding, it’s not difficult for the expenses to add up. Not just for the happy couple, but for the increasingly unhappy guests. If it is a destination wedding, there’s airfare or train fare or gas, on top of hotel expenses. If you are in the wedding party, there is the cost of the tux or dress. Then, to add insult to injury, there is the wedding registry, a relic from the jazz age that has managed to far outlast the era’s other relics, like Prohibition.With Americans increasingly marrying later, and more living together before marriage, fewer newlyweds find themselves without the household necessities to start their lives together. That was the purpose behind bridal registries when they first began at Marshall Field’s in 1924. Today, with marriage increasingly emerging as a class indicator, those who marry tend to fall into two categories: those who are wealthy and those who are educated but not wealthy. That means that any couple hosting a traditional, semi-fancy wedding is either well-off enough that they should not be asking friends to spend their hard-earned money to buy them expensive linens, or the couple has a couple of degrees, along with hefty student loan debt and no savings to buy a home. With that in mind, isn’t it time we all became more practical about wedding gifts?Instead of asking friends for gifts that the couple doesn’t really need, why not replace wedding registries with charitable registries? If the couple is already on stable financial footing — which fewer and fewer young couples are these days — they can encourage friends and family to contribute to a charity of the couple’s choosing. Or if the couple is aspiring to buy a home, and that seems a daunting task, they can encourage guests to make a contribution to their student loan or housing fund.Or the couple could do something wild and crazy, like not ask for gifts at all. After all, many wedding guests these days have plenty of student loan debt, too. But if they are important enough for you to include them on the most important day of your life, then their presence should really be a gift in itself."

If Italy and Spain retain the euro, this will require Germany and other “core” euro zone countries to pay them huge subsidies. Worse, Mediterranean depression can be avoided only if Germany generates major inflation for at least a decade. But if Germany abandons the euro, its rising regional currency (assuming that it would rise) will be just what Germany needs. Prolonged undervaluation of Germany’s relative labor costs has weakened growth, and a rising exchange rate would remove imbalances.German growth has decelerated sharply over the past decade, despite financial and export strengths and labor market reforms. Productivity growth has been cut in half, from 2 percent in the 1990s for output per worker-hour to 1 percent over the past decade. Meanwhile, German citizens have accepted severe wage restraints without the former benefit of a strengthening currency, leading to negligible gains in consumer welfare. And yet wage restraints have served German businesses well. For them, cutting waste is less urgent, which is why worker productivity growth has slowed.Austerity alone is not enough. To avoid a Mediterranean depression, and hugely increased subsidy payments beyond those already committed, Germany would have to accept a wage/price inflation spiral to rebalance its relative costs upward. But Germans hate inflation, and the subdued world economy means there is almost no chance of them experiencing it.Would leaving the euro make Germany seriously uncompetitive and unable to grow? Are Germany’s businesses so weak they need artificially low costs? On the contrary, similar to drug abuse, keeping businesses on an artificially cheap exchange rate causes damage in the case of an overdose. German businesses need the discipline of a higher exchange rate to enforce cost control and productivity gains. German consumers need the lower import costs that a rising currency would bring to raise their spending power without wage inflation. Any excessive rise in the exchange rate could be curbed without inflation by German monetary expansion, which the whole of Europe needs, not just Germany.Without a euro exit, Germany would soon be in big trouble.

It is to the latter that our attention will be focused. In Algeria the “pouvoir” has both secretly and openly sided with Qaddafi's regime during the revolution. It allowed mercenaries to reach Libya, supporting with ammunition and equipment the loyalist forces and, lately, offering asylum on humanitarian grounds to Qaddafi’s wife, daughter and son. This stance created animosity with the Libyan Transitional National Council who resented this support and, therefore, offered help to what remains of the Islamist guerrillas in Algeria. In particular weapons and equipment, originally sent from France to the Libyan rebels, have been found in the hands of Algerian Islamists. The potential for an armed insurrection in Algeria could therefore increase thanks to this rivalry. Moving on to Tunisia, the effects on this country are of a different nature and mainly tied to the evolution of Tunisian domestic dynamics. Were the Tunisian transition to stall for whatever reasons, the example of the Libyan revolt might prompt a reaction among Tunisian radical forces that might want to imitate the Libyan example. The lesson learned might be the following: a change of regime can only happen through armed insurrection. The same could occur in Egypt where the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood can be pushed to react violently to an eventual army’s back off from the initial opening toward a more pluralistic system. In sum, the effects of Qaddafi’s death over neighboring countries lies more on its symbolic meaning than on any practical immediate effect. However, the message that comes from Libya is clear: to depose a dictator with all its support system it is necessary to recur to the use of violence otherwise, as many are saying with respect to Tunisia and Egypt, the octopus of the dictatorial regime can always regenerate itself.

So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that’s what I’m going to do.” His promise of executive orders to deal with issues that have defied legislation comes as the Supreme Court considers his use of recess appointments to avoid intractable Senate approval.What are the strengths and dangers of presidents acting unilaterally?\n",
		"article_content": "Well before his State of the Union message, President Obama signaled that he would be using his executive authority in areas from climate change to the minimum wage if Congress did not act. Not surprisingly, this pledge has invoked outrage from the right, threats of lawsuits, and suggestions from Republicans in Congress that there would be payback if the president ignored or attempts to bypass the legislative branch.Of course, there are limits on presidential authority, and the delegation of executive power in Article II is much less clear and specific than the legislative powers enumerated in Article I. But it is a reality that every president since George Washington (with the exception of poor William Henry Harrison, who served only 32 sickly days in the White House) has used executive orders, including an extraordinary number and scope by activists Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt (who issued an astounding 3,522 of them) not to mention non-activist Calvin Coolidge, responsible for a cool 1,203 executive orders. To this point, Barack Obama has issued fewer executive orders than did George W. Bush.So Obama is well situated in historical precedent to use his executive power — which means not just executive orders, but regulations and less formal executive actions. His desire to do so is understandable; as Tom Mann and I show clearly in our book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” Republicans in Congress, from Obama’s first day in office, followed an explicit strategy to vote in unison against major and most minor initiatives of his, while Republicans in the Senate deliberately slow-walked, via filibusters and holds, even legislation that ultimately passed unanimously or nearly so, just to gum up the works. Despite the spending deal and the new farm bill, there are few signs that we or he have entered a broader era of compromise and achievement.If we have, Obama will be happier, and better served, to go the legislative route. Executive action is cleaner, to be sure, and better than nothing. But it is very limited in its scope and duration. The one executive action announced by Obama Tuesday night, raising the minimum wage for employees of contractors with the government, will affect only a tiny slice of those who have jobs at or near the minimum wage. Executive action, even if it can bring about some policy change, is no substitute for a comprehensive immigration bill, or a broad action to limit carbon emissions.At the same time, executive actions can be significant — and it will be especially interesting to see not just how far Obama is willing to push the envelope, but what court challenges emerge, and how conservative judges, previously champions of executive power, will react when the executive using the power is Barack Obama. The Supreme Court, for example, gave the Environmental  Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions. If somehow this Supreme Court got a case challenging that authority, and took it way, it would show the kind of situational constitutionalism that characterized Bush v. Gore. And show that dysfunction remains the coin of the realm in contemporary American politics."

		"article_content": "After the financial crisis, the value in corporations pursuing profit above all else came under fire. Corporate law itself does not require that corporations relentlessly maximize shareholder value, except in the limited instance when the corporation has put itself up for sale. In fact, state corporate codes (like the ones in Delaware and New York) and corporate charters generally give corporations license to pursue \"any lawful\" purpose. Also, a majority of states — including Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania — have constituency statutes that explicitly allow corporations to consider other stakeholders (e.g. employees, suppliers and customers) in addition to shareholders. Corporations can engage in corporate philanthropy, consider sustainability in making business decisions, adopt social intrapreneurial initiatives and partner with governments and N.G.O.s to address social problems.  A good example of a corporation that has achieved noted success in connecting profit and social interests is Unilever, which through its Unilever Sustainable Living Plan and specific programs like Hindustan Unilever, has reduced energy use and carbon emissions, improved farming practices, reduced the environmental impact of its products and mapped long-term goals for improving global health. Another example is the Patrimonio Hoy program launched by the Mexico-based company Cemex, which provides market-based solutions to address low-income housing needs. While these actions on the part of corporations are not disavowals of profit objectives, they signal an acknowledgement that the relationship between profit motives and social interests need not be sharply separated, or tilt drastically to one side. To falsely divide the world between “profit” and “social good,” and to limit corporate participation to the former, cheapens the value of the corporate form and is wholly inconsistent with the goals of the economy."

We could better ask if having a downed pilot paraded through the streets of Tehran is preferable to cyberattack, or whether it is better to risk the losses that would accompany the series of attacks needed to destroy well-defended nuclear facilities.  With Stuxnet, there are no television shots of burning buildings, weeping victims or tortured pilots.  The politics of cyberattack as an alternative are compelling, although the attacks themselves lack the destructiveness of their kinetic brethren.  The risks of Iran retaliating are not increased.  The regime already blamed Stuxnet on the United States and Israel.  In any case, we have been in sporadic covert conflict with Iran for decades, beginning with the hostages and embassy bombings, Iranian attacks in Iraq, and recent plots -- using proxies to provide a tissue of deniability -- against United States diplomats.    Nor do cyberattacks against Iran increase the risk of damaging cyberattacks against the United States.  It is true that we are defenseless; efforts to make us safer are hamstrung by self-interest, ideology and the gridlock of American politics.  But we are no more vulnerable today than we were the day before the news.  If someone decides to attack us, they may cite Iran as precedent, but it will only be to justify a decision they had already made.        We could ask whether the United States creates more problems for itself when it makes public a new weapon while potential opponents keep it secret.  Four other countries can launch sophisticated and damaging cyber attacks -- including China and Russia -- and plan to use them in warfare.  Another 30 nations are acquiring cyber weapons, including Iran and North Korea.  There is a very old argument for disarmament that holds that if the United States were to renounce some weapons -- usually nuclear weapons -- the world would be a better place.  This utopianism has a revered place in American political thinking, but when humans invent weapons they rarely give them up, especially useful weapons whose components are easy to acquire.  Cyberattack is now part of warfare, no different from any other weapon.  The publicity around Stuxnet may complicate U.S. efforts to get international rules for the use of cyberattack, but the White House decided that tampering with Iran’s nuclear program was more important than possible risk to slow-moving negotiations.Whether a covert program should remain covert is an operational and political decision -- politics usually wins.  Iran was not surprised to learn that the United Sates is using cyberattack, nor was any other major power, and if you think this news is a watershed moment you have been sleeping under a tree.

The pain will be especially acute for independent practices specializing in primary care. They operate with the narrowest margins and have the fewest resources to adjust to the mountain of new regulatory demands being imposed on them.  Many good, dedicated physicians say the administrative burdens of the health care overhaul law and the massive new medical coding system scheduled to take effect Oct. 1, will force them to retire early. These retirements will exacerbate the already serious shortage of physicians at a time when we are bringing millions more patients into our health insurance system.  Rural areas will be hit hardest.Physicians too young to retire are selling their practices to hospitals at a record rate, largely in hopes they will be insulated from the regulatory avalanches.  But this is false protection:  Hospitals will only be the intermediaries in pushing the bureaucratic demands down to physicians.Certainly there is a great need in our health sector for more and better information to assist physicians in making decisions about the best care for their patients.  In theory, hospitals could serve as conduits to inform and guide physicians.  But they are themselves responding to government directives that constrain their ability to focus on the patient.  Ideas and input from physicians will be pushed further down the totem pole, stifling the creativity that has energized medical innovation for more than a generation.If changes are not good for doctors and patients, they are not good for our health system.  More and bigger bureaucracies, whether public or private, are not the answer to what ails our health sector."

That said, the Medicaid recipients saw little average improvement in blood pressure, blood sugar and other measures. Some have said the study demonstrates that by focusing on routine care, such health insurance provides meager results at great cost. Should health insurance, particularly government programs, provide only catastrophic coverage? \n",
		"article_content": "The Oregon study uses a rigorous design to add to our knowledge about the impact of extending coverage to a poor population.  The interpretation of the study has been far less compelling. Bottom line:  if you were a middle class family with private insurance and your spouse’s cholesterol count or blood pressure had not improved in a two year period, would you want to go without insurance protection altogether? If you were a single adult making $15,000 a year or less, would you feel comfortable with a catastrophic coverage plan with a deductible of several thousand dollars a year? You would do neither of these things, but these are the recommendations several pundits seem to think make sense for low income people based on their reading of the Oregon Medicaid experiment.  \n \nTwo years out from the start of the experiment, the Oregon study has confirmed significant improvements among the adults who gained Medicaid coverage. Findings of particular importance include greater probability of receiving diagnosis of diabetes and use of medication for diabetes; 30 percent relative reduction in rate of depression; increased visits, prescription drugs, and use of many preventive services, and the near elimination of catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n \nCritics have focused on the fact that the study found that Medicaid did not have a statistically significant effect on blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood sugar control. Ideally we would like to see these clinical measures change but they are strongly influenced by behavior and nutrition, which are hard to change in any population in a two year time frame. There is no reason to believe private insurance coverage for low-income people would have produced a different outcome. And, as the study authors point out, the power of the study to detect changes in health outcomes was limited because of the relatively small numbers of patients who had diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol.\n \nThey did find significant improvement in depression, which was by far the most prevalent of the four conditions studied.\n \nInsurance -- public or private -- provides financial protection and access to medical care which low-income people need just as everybody else does. But it cannot by itself change behavior, alleviate poverty, or guarantee that the medical system is doing all it can to improve health.\n \n \nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

But many, including environmentalists, have called these efforts useless, as divestment hardly seems to make a financial dent in the industry and it does not directly address the capping of greenhouse gas emissions. Is divestment a useful strategy for mitigating climate change, or is it effective in other ways?\n",
		"article_content": "Students are right to be concerned about climate change, but the focus of the divestment movement is fundamentally misguided.  Students, faculty and staff can be effective by acting in ways that will make a real difference, but the symbolic action of divestment — and the fight to convince universities to do so — has opportunity costs: It diverts us from focusing on what really matters.  Divestment doesn't affect the ability of fossil fuel companies to raise capital: For each institution that divests, there are other investors that take its place.  As long as the world still continues to rely on fossil fuels, and consumes them at current rates, the companies that supply them will have a ready market for their products.What really matters for addressing climate change is enlightened public policy at the international, national and sub-national levels. In particular, it will take serious, economy-wide, carbon-pricing regimes – either carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems – to bring about meaningful reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.At Harvard, where I teach, the student leaders of the divestment movement themselves acknowledge that divestment would not have a financial impact on fossil fuel companies.  For them, divestment is a “moral strategy.” This, to me, presents another problem. Pitching divestment as a moral crusade will play into and exacerbate the ideological divide and political polarization that has paralyzed Washington on climate change (and other issues), diminishing even further the prospects for effective climate policy in the United States.  Whatever moral statement divestment might make is not worth risking further disintegration of the climate-policy process.The real contributions of Harvard and other great research universities to climate change policies will be through our products:  our research, teaching and outreach to policy makers.  That is how great universities have made a difference on other societal challenges for decades and centuries, and it is how we will make a real difference on this one."

For example, approximately one-third of American homes can be remodeled to include an accessory apartment with a separate kitchen and entrance. The major home builders have finally begun to experiment with such designs as well. Cross-generational financial agreements are burgeoning including shared real estate investments and adult children moving back home while saving money to repay college loans (which are exempt from bankruptcy proceedings).

And with technological advances,  education policy makers are rethinking how they view library services in general.    Do superintendents and principals see librarians as more expendable than other school employees? If so, why? (Note: An earlier version of this introduction included a quotation from  Shael Polakow-Suransky, New York City's chief academic officer, about libraries and technology in the classroom, from The Times's news article on nationwide budget pressures on school libraries.  For his views on the issue, see the article.)\n",
		"article_content": "My feeling -- as someone who works in a local tech education center that shares its library with the high school next door -- is that this situation is more complex than administrators' seeing librarians as expendable.In the situation schools are in now, where expenses like staff health insurance costs and I.T. infrastructure budgets are going up by double-digit percentages a year, people have a triage mentality. Some schools are having to reconsider all non-mandated services and make tough decisions. I think a few factors come into play.1. The role of school library media specialists in a world where people can do their own information search and retrieval. Any librarian knows that being able to find information is only a small part of research and scholarship. Information must also be evaluated, a trickier proposition if a student or teacher doesn't know what makes a source credible or worthwhile. In older models, the librarian was more of a selector, protector and a preserver of resources. Now a librarian, or school media specialist, is more of a discerning cultivator and a matchmaker between people and the widely varied resources that meet their information needs. Media and technology literacy is more important than ever, but the integral role of librarians isn't always obvious from the outside; as a result their contributions can be undervalued.2. The lack of metrics for the value of libraries in an educational setting. Libraries have value, social value and educational value. However, library and technology literacy are often not built into state educational standards. I went to a college where library instruction was a necessary part of your first year of college; this is becoming the case less and less. With No Child Left Behind and other assessments pushed increasingly to the forefront of educational goals, belt-tightening will often involve eliminating what can't be counted or assessed.Looking at California's Common Core State Standards, for example, after what happened in the Los Angeles Unified School District, a lot of emphasis is placed on what children should be learning but there is less emphasis on how they learn it. A fifth grader is supposed to be able to \"gather relevant information from print and digital sources,\" but somehow the word library isn't written into that process anywhere, so people conclude that it's nonessential. No matter how effective teachers are, children will still be left behind if they don't have librarians to help them navigate the information environment.3. The increasing costs of maintaining an adequate school library media center as information shifts to both online distribution  and license-not-own models. Libraries are purchasing fewer print materials, and more digital materials. The world of digital materials is complex and rapidly evolving. The shift to electronic resources makes sense, but brings with it the expenses of maintaining a computer lab and multiple vendor contracts for e-content and databases, contracts with terms and costs that change frequently. In uncertain times, this situation can concern administrators as being hard to control and possibly not sustainable in a system with annual budgeting.My concern, as someone who works with people who lack technological access and education, is that removing school librarians and media specialists from the educational environment will have the largest effect on those whose information access is already hampered by the same pressures that are affecting our schools.

An analysis of the most recent assessment of 74 education systems around the world offers some interesting points about how teaching is viewed in top-performing countries. The report, \"What the U.S. Can Learn From the World's Most Successful Education Reform Efforts,\" found that in high-scoring countries like Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada and South Korea, teachers have higher status and are typically paid better relative to other workers.

I understand why students in the top third academically refuse to become teachers, while in Finland, Singapore and South Korea, teaching candidates are selected only from the top third. What we, as teachers, need to do is take back our profession. Most teachers will take to the streets and protest over salaries, pensions and working conditions, but how many teachers would do the same if someone who has never taught their grade level or subject, imposed a new curriculum or demanded that certain pedagogy be followed? Until practicing classroom teachers are allowed to make real decisions regarding curriculum, assessment, textbooks and professional development, the status of teachers will remain low. At the moment, our profession seems to be in the hands of politicians, researchers, special interest groups, school system bureaucracies, unions, technology companies and textbook publishers. Even though I highly respected the members of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel I served on, I was the only practicing K through 12 teacher on the panel. Why should bright high school students decide to become teachers if they suspect that everyone will make decisions concerning their profession except them? In the 1990s, I spent three weeks during a few of my summers teaching for the Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Talented Youth. I found it fascinating how instructors were treated and respected. They were careful in who they hired, but once hired they trusted you to plan and teach your assigned course to your students without interference. Even though I was teaching sixth graders, I felt the prestige of a college professor. This is how teachers should feel each and every day in their classrooms if the status of teaching is to be raised. \n"

Whether you look at Finland, South Korea, Shanghai, Singapore and elsewhere, you find common standards and expectations for students. In the U.S., states have spent billions of dollars developing state and local standards, and finding out that the process led to more standards than any teacher could teach in a given year and more standards than any student could learn. But what we also found out is that from state to state, there was a “common core” of expectations – and that this common core was not nearly as rigorous as what other countries were expecting.It is also time for us to look closely at funding discrepancies not just between states but also between school districts in states. The greatest predictor of funding level and success of students in our schools is the ZIP code of a school. The federal role has always been about leveling the playing field for students who need significant support – children with special needs and children from poverty. That is the right impulse.

Recently, at the University of Alberta, 56 Canadian academics applied for the $400,000-a-year job of the departing president in groups of four to highlight the pay disparity. Are university presidents overpaid, or does the compensation appropriately reflect their wide range of management, recruitment and fund-raising duties?\n",
		"article_content": "Learning takes place everywhere on a college campus. And sometimes, when what is taught outside the classroom undermines and contradicts what you learn in class, classroom instruction becomes meaningless. Students, for example, may learn the value of fair employment practices in history and literature classes. They may learn the risks to political stability that the exploitation of workers brings. But the values communicated in these lessons do not have much staying power if the college’s own practices dishonor them.When a college or university president has an annual salary 50 times what some faculty and staff earn, the institution delivers a powerful message about its values. It creates an educational laboratory that resonates with contempt for the notion that the campus is a community and a workplace in which fairness and concern for all rules. And it tells students they can set aside classroom learning and classroom values when they leave college and go to work elsewhere. If what is supposed to be an institution embodying higher values imitates the income disparities in a corporation devoted to maximizing profit at the expense of its workforce, why shouldn’t every employer do the same?And if students learn that adjunct faculty are earning less than the minimum wage and cannot live on their income, while the university president earns a million dollars a year or more, that practical lesson may trump the other values the institution promotes. A university president is a leader whose salary has considerable symbolic value. It sends a message about the character of the institution and what it stands for.

But Pokémon Go, the sensational augmented reality app that overlays the real world with a digital game, has sent young people flooding into the streets and parks to catch Pokémon and explore the world around them. Does the Pokémon Go phenomenon show that technology can bring people into the real world, or is it just tying them in a new way to the digital realm?\n",
		"article_content": "I’ve never spent as much time outside as I did last weekend, as evidenced by my first sunburn in years. I was playing Pokémon Go.The augmented reality game is the most horribly designed app I’ve ever been obsessed with: It suffers from clunky technical design and it uses a laughably insecure infrastructure to grab up way more personal information than it needs. But critiques of the more Luddite variety are off base. Pokémon Go kept me outside and active, and it turned out that searching for the adorable little monsters in augmented reality gave me a new way to enjoy the city around me — I spent days discovering historical landmarks, parks, statues and street art all around the places Pokémon were hiding. Pokémon Go was created by the maker of the augmented reality game Ingress. Despite likely bestowing Pokémon Go with its terrible interface and feeble server capacity, Ingress left a valuable legacy inside this feel-good hit of the summer. Ingress is a science fiction game in which users tag real-world locations as portals, for which players then vie for control. The real-world locations of the Ingress are the same locations that are now used as Poké stops, where players of Pokémon Go can receive Pokéballs, potions and other items.\n \nAnd because the Ingress portals tend to be landmarks of historical or civic significance, Pokémon Go has richly annotated the art and history of our cities, and even highlights obscure neighborhood quirks and finds. Last weekend, I sought out a Poké stop in the San Francisco neighborhood of Hayes Valley only to find it was a tiny koi fish stenciled into the sidewalk. In Berkeley, I collected Pokéballs at a portrait of the Black Panther’s Bobby Seale, which was painted on the side of a metal utility box near City Hall (also a Poké stop).\n \nLured in by the promise of a Bulbasaur, I spent Sunday morning inside a sunny, beautiful community garden hidden from the street view.\n \nLater that afternoon, a friend and I boarded a streetcar only to run into a group of young men clustered in the back, looking at their smartphones and chatting animatedly. “Pokémon?” I asked. They laughed, both delighted and embarrassed. “We took the F because we thought it would be slow enough to hatch our eggs,” they told me. “Us too,” I admitted.\n \nThe whole group of us spent the rest of the afternoon near San Francisco’s piers, catching the water-dwelling Pokémon that congregate there in augmented reality. The sun was hot, but nobody was tired or bored. All around us, other players used lures — a relatively scarce in-game item — to attract more Pokémon to our location, bestowing their largess to their fellow Poké-obsessed city residents. \n \nThanks to Pokémon Go, I've been talking to more strangers on public transit, in restaurants, and on the street. One was a neighbor I had never spoken with, who stopped walking his dog and took out his headphones to ask me why I was standing on the sidewalk with my phone pointed in the air. Something about the sheer silliness of cute cartoon monsters interposed over our lonely realities seems to break the bubbles we’ve built around ourselves.\n \nPokémon Go gave me new eyes with which to look at my city. It pushed me to enjoy the sunshine and fresh air, and to strike up conversations with strangers. What more could you ask for of any game — digital or otherwise?"

Since John Hinckley Jr. was acquitted of trying to kill President Reagan, the use of the insanity defense has become very restricted in federal cases. Arizona, along with several other states, no longer allows a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity.In the three decades since the Hinckley case, brain research and brain scans have made many advances in diagnosing and categorizing mental illness. Yet this seems to have little bearing on how society deals with insanity and culpability in the legal arena. \n \nWhat has been learned in the decades since the Hinckley case? Should a better medical understanding of mental illness alter our legal definitions of insanity? Or is the insanity defense rooted in principles or traditions that actually don't have much to do with medicine? \n \n\n",
		"article_content": "Psychiatrists have a high degree of agreement in ordinary clinical settings regarding a diagnosis like schizophrenia.  Disagreement is most common early in the course of illness when diagnosticians may agree on a psychotic illness -- a break from reality associated with false beliefs, hallucinations and disturbance in the flow of thought -- but be uncertain as to whether the overall pattern will be schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, or drug-induced psychoses or one of a number of other specific psychotic disorders.  Science has advanced knowledge on the genetic and environmental origin of these disorders.  Neuroimaging studies have made clear where and how development and function of the brain has been disturbed.  A range of laboratory assessments of cognition and electrophysiology reliably distinguish psychotic disorders from non-ill controls.  Despite many advances in understanding the disorders, science has not yet produced biomarkers or diagnostic tests that are sufficiently specific for each diagnosis to be applied in individual cases.  This need not, however, deter courts in considering an insanity defense.  The courts in most states recognize schizophrenia, for example, as a psychotic illness that qualifies for this defense.  Most cases are resolved without trial and often with extensive agreements among experts.  Those that go to trial may often have agreement as to diagnosis, at least at the level of psychotic symptoms.  The insanity defense is not based on the presence of illness, but on whether the person, because of the illness, met the standard at the time when the crime was committed.  Science has not, and probably cannot, answer this question.  This is for the jury.  If the diagnosis of psychosis is in doubt, the jury may conclude that the defense is not based on a qualifying diagnosis. If psychosis is present, the jury must the weigh all the information and determine whether, at the time of the crime, the standard is met.In the post-Hinckley era, the standard in many states has become a simple cognitive test that has little relationship to the scientific or clinical knowledge regarding psychotic illness. Rather than state of mind and the defendant's understanding of his or her actions, the standard is close to simply whether the defendant knew the act was unlawful. Insanity acquittals, already rare, now face an almost impossible standard.\n"

While the cost of living in these cities has skyrocketed, wages remain stagnant for many low- and middle-income residents — so much so that half of New York City residents say they can barely make ends meet. How can cities with high-cost housing markets, like New York, better serve the homeless?\n\n",
		"article_content": "In considering how best to help the homeless in high-cost housing markets, it's important to be clear about whom we're talking.For street, or chronically, homeless people, housing cost is often a less important problem than mental health, drug or alcohol issues. This kind of homelessness is not limited to high-rent cities: As a nation, we need to find ways to connect these individuals to the services they need, but often themselves reject.  For this group, short-term quasi-institutional settings — supportive housing — can make sense.But for the many families — most often low-income single mothers and children — housed in homeless shelters or seeking assistance, homelessness is simply a term for the high price of housing compared to their income. There will inevitably be neighborhoods in which they cannot afford to live, of course, including some neighborhoods where costs were once low.  That's the nature of dynamic city economies.  At the same time, we must do our best not to impede the capacity of housing markets to serve the full range of income groups. Rent regulation, for instance, discourages housing turnover, leading to artificially lower vacancy rates. Regardless of their ability to pay a higher rent, households in rent regulated apartments protect their good deals even if they no longer need the space.Federal housing vouchers — of which more than 100,000 are distributed in New York — also lead to lower vacancy rates in assistance housing units because the deals are open-ended: Even those whose income might enable them to find housing without assistance have no reason to give it up.  The same is true in public housing, where, in New York, some 20 percent of households have empty bedrooms and the average time in the system is 22 years.   Easing limitations on construction would also open up the market, and allow those who need lower-cost housing to get it. As more units come on the market, upward pressure on market-rent costs would ebb, and supply would be adjusted to demand.Finally, we should help connect low-income households with low-cost housing that is already available. Using federal census data and the housing website StreetEasy, I found that there are thousands of affordable New York apartments for those earning as little as half the area median income. It's tempting but expensive to subsidize new units reserved for select income groups, but it's also costly and benefits very few.  It is better to help housing markets work  — a benefit to all.   "

The bigger battle is not just about the important legal recognition of same-sex unions, but the recognition that kinship and fidelity are not bound up solely in the bonds of marriage. I love weddings.  I love the ritual, the coming together of chosen and biological families, and the cake. The weekend before  Justice Kennedy gave the majority opinion in the Obergefell v. Hodges case, I watched my 5-year-old bear the rings for the wedding of his beloved godmama to her new wife. Yet in my exceeding happiness for them, I recognize that the ultimate battle is to remove any requirements of marriage or coupledom from any of the important benefits they are attached to, and to allow people to design the kinds of intimate networks they choose.  Why can’t I designate a person of my choosing in the absence of a spouse to receive health benefits earned through my labor if they “embody … family and sacrifice” for me?  A person should be able to choose anyone they love without the mythology of being “in love” that permeates the way these important benefits are designated now.  The legal tools used to bond the family we make beyond marriage are weak and easily subject to challenge.  The idea that marriage is the only way to have someone present for you is absurd and devalues the relationships single people create in their lives.   "

What’s behind this kind of deception?\n",
		"article_content": "Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal’s reported exaggeration of his military record is a shock to many supporters. But the irresistible temptation to invent or exaggerate military service is commonto politicians and non-politicians alike.\nWhether it is a pick-up line in a bar or a boast on Memorial Day, people often learn that a little fib of military service can go along way in achieving certain advantages. It is a way of instantly giving yourself abetter image — perhaps becoming the person you wish you were.\nFor the state’s top prosecutor (and a senatorial candidate), such claims are particularly problematic. Blumenthal’s office routinely prosecutes fraud and false statements in various contexts. Moreover,federal law makes certain false military claims a criminal matter. (Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, a person claiming specific military decorations or medals could be sentenced to a year in jail).\nWhat is fascinating is that Blumenthal was already considered one of the nation’s leading politicians and lawyers. He is not some Walter Mitty who desperately wants to reinvent himself like Steven Burton,39, of Palm Springs, who appeared at his high school reunion in a Marine Corps uniform supporting about a pound of medals.\nBurton was just some schmo who worked in a bank and decided to remake himself into a decorated officer. Blumenthal is the guy that many people want to pretend to be: a Harvard-educated lawyer with a record offighting for the public interest. Yet, even he wanted a degree of personal enhancement or reinvention.\nIn that sense he is similar to other leading citizens like Illinois Circuit Judge Michael F. O’Brien who claimed not one but two Congressional Medals of Honor. Likewise, there was Admiral Jeremy MichaelBoorda, the 25th Chief of Naval Operations, who was a legend in the service as the only C.N.O. to have reached that position from the enlisted ranks. He committed suicide after being accused of wearing unearned“Combat Vs” on his Navy Commendation Medal and Navy Achievement Medal indicating valor in combat.\nFor politicians, the desire to claim military distinctions is sometimes irresistible. Politicians thrive on symbols and rhetoric that create bonds with the public. Military service is perhaps the strongest suchself-authenticating qualification.

But coming out of the Kyoto’s magnificent conference hall, I consoled myself that this small step would lead to a giant step later.That giant step never came, though. After 17 years, emissions are about 60 percent greater, not 5 percent less.The international climate agreement also failed miserably in meeting its pledge to provide developing countries with $10 billion a year from 2010 to 2012, rising to 100 billion per year by 2020, to mitigate the effects of climate change and help them deal with their own rising emissions as a result of needed development.The Kyoto Protocol’s tenure is over and negotiations for the next protocol, to be agreed to in Paris in 2015, have started. The world would be better with an alternative approach.But last week, I witnessed the emergence of promising protocols -- albeit of different nature -- during the United Nations Climate Summit.  Not only the march of hundreds of thousand of people from all the strata of the society, but also the innovations that communities, businesses and coalitions are taking up without any international agreement.The Rockefeller Foundation announced that it would disinvest all its assets in fossil energy starting with $100 billion. Over 180 institutions, organizations and pension funds have begun to follow. The first ever Global Agricultural Alliance was launched to enable 500 million farmers worldwide to practice climate-smart agriculture by 2030. Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a voluntary group of nearly 100 states and non-state actors pledged to reduce short-lived greenhouse gases such as black carbon, methane and hydrofluorocarbons.But to stabilize greenhouse gases and limit the earth’s temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, we need a third way to help communities, businesses and coalitions acting on their own agreements. We need the United Nations, with its multilateralism, to be a coordinator of all activities, to provide an early warning alarm to growing dangers, to identify the gaps between actions undertaken and actions needed, to prevent conflicts and and inspire all to act and act as of urgency.International agreements, like the Montreal Protocol, were needed to save the ozone layer. But that was an exception. Without international agreement the life expectancy all over the world has improved, many discoveries were made to fight diseases, digital technologies were developed and democracies are spreading steadily.All this occurred without international agreements, but with the United Nations playing an active role."

A core humanities list that includes Homer, Shakespeare and Cervantes will tell you very different things about the world around you than a list that also includes Ibn Battuta, Khayyam and Tagore. Students learn best when they are exposed to several different modes of thinking, which is what a diverse reading list should do.   But mention the need for greater inclusion of literary traditions and there will inevitably be accusations that standards are being relaxed in favor of diversity (or \"political correctness,\" which seems to be a theme of nearly every news story these days.) However, diversity does not mean sacrificing quality. It means seeking out excellent work from a range of different voices. It means connecting students to human experience not just across time and space, but also across race and gender. Of course, this discussion always ends with a challenge: Well, whom would you include, then? I think every American student should read \"The Conquest of New Spain,\" by Bernal Diaz del Castillo, an eyewitness account to the Cortes’s arrival in Mexico and his overthrow of Montezuma; Toni Morrison’s \"Song of Solomon,\" a brilliant novel about identity and history; Naguib Mahfouz’s \"Cairo Trilogy,\" an expansive and beautiful work about family; and J.M. Coetzee’s \"Waiting for the Barbarians,\" a deeply allegorical novel about empire and, more generally, political power. Including classics like these will not impoverish the humanities curriculum, it will enrich it. It will teach students to see the world at it is, in all its glorious diversity. "

Defeating Barack Obama in 2012 may be a primary goal for some Republican leaders. But analysts are saying that the new Republican-led House will have to compromise with the Democrats to avoid a repeat of the Newt Gingrich-led revolt in the House in 1994, which led to a government shutdown. Polling shows that voters who rejected the Democrats want to curb federal spending and the deficit, but also want to keep entitlements, tax cuts and services. Can the Republicans avoid gridlock and deliver on their commitments?\n",
		"article_content": " “The deficit is a trump card and conservatives currently hold it,” according to the centrist group Third Way’s summary of its poll on attitudes about economic policy in July. The poll showed what this week’s elections confirmed. Despite large Democratic majorities in Congress and a dynamic young president, liberals were unable to use the opportunity presented to them in 2008 to restore Americans’ New Deal/Great Society confidence in the government’s ability to solve big problems.Now, far sooner than seemed possible 24 months ago, conservatives have an opening to vindicate their raison d’être, limiting government according to  constitutional standards and purposes, rather than expanding it indefinitely.  The voters are justifiably dubious about President Obama’s repeated assurances that all the Democrats’ new spending plans can be added to the list of commitments the government had made before January 2009, and still be responsibly financed by tax increases confined to the most prosperous 2 percent of American households. As such, they are receptive to the general idea that the government’s spending commitments, new and old, must be aligned with taxes the people are able and willing to pay. \n \nThe deficit trump card is good for conservatives to hold, but not easy to play. Next year  will mark the 30th anniversary of the idea that tax cuts would “starve the beast,” rendering politically feasible and even inevitable reductions in government spending that would never have happened otherwise. The beast, however, turned out to be hungry but not fussy. If it  couldn’t eat taxed dollars he would happily devour borrowed ones.\n \nNow that the supplies of taxed and borrowed dollars are running short, the question the American republic has been dodging for decades demands an answer. Do we still want Big Government if it means collecting the Big Taxes its operation requires? Or are we prepared to ratchet down our spending commitments to align them with the taxes we’re prepared to pay? During those decades conservatives have believed that when push came to shove, Americans would accept the program cuts necessary to avoid big tax increases, and liberals have believed that Americans would accept the tax increases necessary to avoid big program cuts.\n \nThe resolution, either cobbled together all at once or rolled out over several years, is going to be some mixture of tax increases and spending cuts. The fight will be over the ratios. Republicans are pushing to extend the Bush tax cuts in hopes of making the ultimate resolution rely primarily on spending cuts. Democrats are determined not to yield on their health care reform, in the hope that its spending commitments will force the tax issue. Push is coming to shove, in other words.In a divided government with the countdown to the 2012 elections already underway, both parties will face tricky questions about their agendas and the way they present them to the American people.

		"instruction": "Headline: Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?\nInstructions: Agriculture is a bright spot in the American economy, with exports humming and commodity prices rising.  Why do farmers, especially well-off farmers, still need the billions in subsidies they are guaranteed every year?  It's a question that has been asked by fiscal conservatives and liberal environmentalists, by the editorial pages of both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, by President Obama and, before him, by President Bush.  With a House full of newly elected Republicans who pledged to cut federal spending, will the next farm bill be different? Some new members of Congress, like Kristi Noem of South Dakota, campaigned as deficit hawks, but have defended subsidies as a national security issue: the decline of farms could mean more food imports, they say. (Ms. Noem had partial ownership in a ranch that received more than $3 million in subsidies over 15 years, before her family bought her out last year.)Do payments to farms protect national security? Or, more broadly, how should the farm subsidy program be changed?  \n",
		"article_content": "If the newly elected Republican congressmen and senators are really serious about their desire for limited government, they should move swiftly to curtail the huge farm subsidy program.  It has been a failure right from its start in 1933 under President Franklin Roosevelt.  F.D.R.'s Agricultural Adjustment Act sought to cure the problem of overproduction of crops, and low prices for those crops, by paying farmers not to produce.  If farmers were paid not to produce on part of their land, they would harvest smaller crops and that would in turn raise prices of those crops.  What happened when we paid farmers not to produce?  First, Americans had to pay more for bread, corn and cotton shirts.  The higher prices for farmers meant price increases for customers buying farm products.  Second, because farmers were growing smaller crops, we used up more quickly the food being grown, and soon had to import the very crops we were paying farmers not to produce.  In 1935, the U.S. imported 36 million pounds of cotton, 13 million bushels of wheat, and 34 million bushels of corn.  In other words, we paid farmers not to produce what we were paying foreigners to send us from overseas.  All of this during a Great Depression, when 10 million Americans were unemployed and needed the cheap food the U.S. government was refusing to allow farmers to produce.Why did such a strange farm subsidy system survive and persist?  Not because it worked well, but because farmers lobbied to keep it.  They enjoyed the extra income from being paid to set aside part of their land.  Subsidies beat the whims of a free market.   Since our farmers are the best equipped farmers in the world, why not drop the subsidies and let them grow what they can, and let the U.S. export food to the rest of the world."

		"instruction": "Headline: Preventing Cruelty to Farm Animals\nInstructions: This spring, new laws were proposed in Iowa, Minnesota and Florida that would make it a crime to take undercover videos or photos at industrial farms, a tactic often used by activists to show mistreatment of animals and unsanitary conditions. Supporters of such legislation say farm operations need protection from interlopers, while opponents argue that the bad operators should be punished, not those who expose cruel practices. With billions of cows, pigs and chickens being raised in large facilities, what can government, with limited resources, do to reduce abusive treatment of animals? Or will better animal welfare depend largely on consumers being willing to pay more for meat and eggs raised under higher standards?   \n",
		"article_content": "Industrialized animal operations -- grim, intensely crowded confinement warehouses -- externalize their true costs in terms of public health threats, environmental damage and animal suffering.  These problems have been widely documented by governments, universities and credible organizations like the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production. Yet the industry’s political influence has stymied desperately needed reforms.  Consumers choosing foods from environmentally sound, humane farms hold the greatest promise for positive change.  But governments can and should be addressing this urgent question, too.  Here are five necessary and achievable reforms.1. State laws should protect farm animal welfare. Polls show that about 90 percent of Americans believe farm animals deserve humane living conditions.  Narrow metal cages for pregnant pigs, crates for veal calves and cramped cages for egg laying hens should be outlawed.  California, Colorado, Michigan and several other states have already adopted such laws.2. Congress should prohibit overusing antibiotics in animal farming.  About 80 percent of antibiotics used in the United States each year is in the daily feed of farm animals, mostly to enable keeping animals in densely crowded conditions, which reduces costs. Recent research found half of meat tested from U.S. grocery stores contaminated with staph infections, half of which were antibiotic resistant. Banning subtherapeutic antibiotics in agriculture, as the European Union has already done, would ease overcrowding and make our food safer.  3. Government should better enforce environmental laws. Environmental laws like the Clean Water Act cover animal agriculture.  However, federal and state environmental agencies have largely failed to apply them.  Forcing animal agriculture to bear its true environmental costs would tip the economic balance in favor of farms with smaller herds and less crowding.  4. Farm subsidies should foster grass.  Grass is a happier, healthier habitat for farm animals.  It also is the core of ecological farming, even offering the promise of major carbon sequestration.  Yet current federal farm policies encourage plowing grasslands while discouraging grass-based methods, like crop rotations, that safeguard soil, water and air.  Farm subsidies should contain incentives for grass and require farmers to follow good conservation methods. 5. The United States should launch a domestic Peace Corps for farming.  America needs to repopulate rural America and stimulate beneficial jobs for young people. Our nation struggles with unemployment, and yet traditional farming is disappearing partly because it is more labor intensive.  Training the next generation in sustainable agriculture and assisting them to start new farms could be a brave president’s boldest and most lasting initiative.These sensible reforms are financially doable, even in today’s fiscally constrained budgets.  They would go a long way toward reestablishing a food system that is safe, environmentally sound and humane.  Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate. "

		"instruction": "Headline: Who Should Get Financial Aid?\nInstructions: It’s that time of year: College students are applying for financial aid, and wondering how they’ll make up the difference if grants, scholarships and loans don’t cover the tuition bill. Is the system for financial aid helping the people who need it most? What factors should determine eligibility for financial aid from the government and from colleges?\n",
		"article_content": "Once viewed as a public good, post-secondary schooling is now thought of as a private commodity. State support for colleges and universities has waned, and tuition rates have skyrocketed in response. Students and their families have responded by borrowing unprecedented amounts, at unprecedented rates. There is no guarantee students will graduate with jobs sufficient to repay their debt — or that they will graduate at all. Creative solutions are needed to help students and families of limited means. 1. Reconsider need-based institutional aid. Recent trends in the institutional aid offered to students indicate that merit is supplanting need. Many universities engage in financial-aid leveraging, whereby small “merit” scholarships are distributed among several affluent students with good (but not extraordinary) records in lieu of more substantial need-based aid for one less privileged student. This recruitment technique reflects the fact that public universities rely increasingly on tuition dollars to remain solvent. This strategy assumes that less privileged students benefit only from large grants, which are increasingly difficult for universities to provide. That assumption is flawed. Recently, the provost of Georgia State University tried an experiment. When a large number of current students were at risk of being dropped because they couldn't pay their fees, the university gave them small grants, under $1,000. The program succeeded in retaining students — which meant retaining $660,000 in tuition dollars that would otherwise have been forgone. It suggests that universities can simultaneously meet the bottom line and contribute to educational equality.2. Use different measures of dependency. Need-based student aid and loan amounts are typically calculated using the federal government's estimate for \"expected family contribution\" — which may not bear any relation to the parental assistance students actually receive. Undergraduate students are considered dependents unless they have children or are: over 23, married, a member of the military, an orphan, a ward of the court, an emancipated minor, homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Dependents must report parental income on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and it is considered in calculating the expected family contribution. This poses a severe hardship for students who are financially independent. A measurement based on student reports of actual expected contributions would alleviate this burden. Given the financial constraints families face, there would be temptation to game the system. However, students and parents could sign a legally binding document stating their financial relationship (if any), and proof may be required to show financial independence through individual earnings in the first year of college.3. Create a new model for student support. Oregon’s innovative “Pay It Forward” legislation is neither traditional student aid nor a student loan. When the law is in full effect, Oregon high school graduates will be able to attend public institutions in the state at no initial cost if they agree to contribute a small percentage of their future income to help pay for other students in the program. This program provides a safety net for students who may be unsure of their ability to pay off conventional loans after college. It makes no judgment about the ability of a family to pay, and offers all students freedom from crippling debt."

If so, is it ethical to have a pet if you cannot afford such treatments?\n",
		"article_content": "Expensive treatments now available in veterinary medicine pose profound dilemmas for pet lovers. In every case we need to consider the meaning and significance of people’s bonds with their pets, as well as the most humane decision for the animal. Abundant studies document the health and mental health benefits to humans of their bonds with companion animals. They offer joy, affection, a sense of security and faithful companionship. Most pet owners have strong attachments with their pets. Many, particularly if living alone, consider them their most significant relationship. In family life, pets are treated as valued members of the family. They play an important role in everyday family functioning, and they support the resilience of children through times of adversity. It’s not uncommon or abnormal for individuals to grieve as profoundly with the death of their pet as with the loss of a human loved one.  So it’s understandable that many pet owners are reluctant to forgo treatments, especially for a beloved animal that is suffering or may die. Until recently, euthanasia (“putting down” an animal) was the most common decision in such situations. Devoted pet lovers increasingly go to great lengths for veterinary care, even forgoing expenses on themselves.  Yet, the costs of treatments, the inadequacy and unaffordability of insurance coverage, or caregiving burdens must also be weighed, as well as medical considerations like the age, prognosis and well being of the animal. Profound ethical questions are raised when, as with medical advances for human treatments, we must grapple with the many considerations. People should not be judged if they cannot, or decide not to, provide all available treatments for their pet, just as they may not be able to, or may decide not to, for themselves or their child or a loved one. These are intensely personal ethical decisions. Crucial conversations between veterinarians and pet owners are most helpful.

The Arizona law required public matching funds for participating candidates when their opponents who had opted out of the public system or  independent groups  increased their private spending.  The court vote was 5 to 4, with the majority opinion -- written by  Chief Justice John Roberts -- deciding that  the law violated the First Amendment rights of candidates who raise private money. In a dissent summarized from the bench, Justice Elena Kagan said the Arizona law advanced First Amendment values. \"The system discriminated against no ideas and prevented no speech,” she wrote.  What are the likely legal and political  implications of the ruling and what are the next battlegrounds on public financing of campaigns? \n",
		"article_content": "The Supreme Court's decision today will significantly affect how courts construe campaign finance laws and how the government can regulate political campaigns.The court looked beyond the government's preferred justifications and examined the intent and effect of a campaign finance law.  The court has recognized only one narrow exception to the rule that the government could not regulate political activity constitutionally: the government could limit the size of contributions to candidates to combat corruption or its appearance.  Not surprisingly, the government here argued that its law was designed to fight corruption.  The court instead determined, based on the law itself, its history and its effect, that this concern was secondary to its actual purpose: to limit spending in campaigns to level the electoral playing field among publicly financed candidates and those who would not or could not take government money.In other words, the Supreme Court engaged in real analysis and did not simply defer to the government.  Going forward, the government must be truly motivated by legitimate concerns when regulating speech; after-the-fact justifications will no longer cut it.  The second significant development was the court's willingness to strike down laws that allowed the government to do indirectly what it is forbidden constitutionally from doing directly.  Because the government could not directly limit spending in political races, Arizona sought to achieve the same result by creating a disincentive to spend more than the government wanted.  If that speaker spent too much, the government would directly subsidize the campaigns of those with whom the speaker disagreed, thus directly undermining their entire political effort.  The court recognized correctly that this rationale would allow the government to burden speech so long as it was clever enough to avoid an outright cap.The end result for public financing is that the government may still subsidize campaigns.  However, in doing so, it cannot put its thumb on the scales in political campaigns in favor of publicly financed candidates.  It is unfortunate we needed the court to tell the government and campaign finance \"reformers\" something so evident. "

Although the presidential race is tightening, Romney continues to trail Obama in national polls, and Obama holds a double-digit lead with female voters. For Obama, Akin’s words meshed nicely with his  “war on women” theme. If Akin’s comments enter into centrist voters’ calculations, they undercut Romney’s support. To the extent that voters focus on the “war on women” rather than the economy, Romney is again hurt among centrists. The Romney camp wants to inoculate itself from Akin’s comments and return the focus to the economy. Republicans are also anxious to regain the Senate, and they thought they were well positioned to unseat a one-term senator, Claire McCaskill, Akin’s opponent. McCaskill had lost an earlier statewide election, and she remains vulnerable. Indeed, Akin remains in a virtual dead heat. But Republicans know that there are strong viable replacements, given that Akin prevailed in a multicandidate primary with a plurality of less than 40 percent.What about constituents? Most constituents pay attention to politics only intermittently. Elections help to hone their focus. Are Akin’s comments outrageous to them? One might think that voters have strongly held opinions about abortion, but public opinion polls consistently indicate otherwise.  About a quarter of the population would like to see abortion illegal under all circumstances, but about half  want abortion services legal under some circumstances. Year after year, most people say that their stand on abortion depends on the circumstances. Indeed, many people hold ambivalent views on abortion. For instance, they might oppose abortion but want it to be safe and legal. Although Akin’s comments are very close in tone and substance to earlier pronouncements that he and other conservative Republicans have made on abortion, the difference now is that closely contested elections focus the attention of party leaders and constituents alike.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

		"article_content": "For the first time, millions of Americans across the country have the peace of mind that health insurance provides.\n \nBut more needs to be done to ensure coverage is affordable so that the expanded access to health insurance is sustained.  First, policymakers need to address provisions in the health care reform law that are at odds with the goal of affordability.  For example, the new health insurance tax, which took effect this year, is increasing by an eye-popping 40 percent next year and will add nearly $400 to an average family's health care costs in 2015. This tax makes coverage more expensive and should be repealed.\n \nSecond, policymakers must resist the temptation to limit new payment arrangements and benefit design flexibility that enable health plans to offer affordable coverage options to consumers. High-value provider networks are part of the broad array of strategies health plans use to ensure consumers receive the best value for their health care dollars. These networks are made up of a smaller number of doctors and hospitals that have a track record of providing the highest quality and most cost-efficient care to patients.  A recent McKinsey analysis found that policies with high-value networks had premiums that were 26 percent lower than comparable options with broader networks. Unfortunately, politicians at the state and federal level are considering proposals to limit these initiatives and other efforts that individuals and families rely on for affordable premiums. \n \nNow the debate needs to focus on how to keep coverage affordable. Any provision in the law that is at odds with that goal should be changed. New proposals that would undermine affordability should be rejected."

		"instruction": "Headline: Are Big Banks Out of Control?\nInstructions: In March 2009, JPMorgan Chase’s “compliance function” sent a letter asking the bank’s manager for its Bernie Madoff account to certify that Madoff was complying with all laws and regulations. But Madoff had been arrested three months earlier in the all-time biggest Ponzi scheme.That clueless letter is one indication of how the bank had turned a blind eye to the Madoff fraud for years. The deferred prosecution agreement and $2 billion in penalties that resulted, were among several scandals,  in which Chase paid  $20 billion in fines and other giant  banks have been penalized billions for money laundering, mortgage fraud and other transgressions. Does the lack of compliance show that some banks have gotten too big to manage properly?\n",
		"article_content": "The Madoff scandal exposed governance problems in a huge range of businesses and charities, making clear that the profit motive can override prudence in big and small enterprises alike. Large banks should not receive any special treatment in response to this and other instances of financial markets' misbehavior. Regulators and prosecutors should apply the full force of the law to people and institutions of all sizes. With respect to JPMorgan, investors must consider whether the string of penalties it has faced, including the latest $1.7 billion for Madoff-related misbehavior, represents the legacy of the past or is instead a sign of structural issues that portend further losses.  This matters a lot for shareholders, whose money is appropriately on the line.  My sense, however, is that there is not a threat to the financial system or economy as a whole.  The skein of negative news items and consequent penalties is an enforcement issue, rather than a systemic risk that would be a front-and-center  concern for U.S. policy makers.After all, as noted in The Times, JPMorgan has easily sufficient capital to pay the fines and to take the losses from other problems such as the botched London Whale trades and bad mortgages. The firm is not at risk of collapse. This hints at progress made since the financial crisis in strengthening the U.S. financial system. U.S. banks are financed with considerably more capital than previously, meaning that they can suffer more losses (or fines) before failing.  And if a large bank does fail, the resolution authority in the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform legislation provides legal authority not previously available to deal with failing large banks.  The demise of a large bank will be no minor event, but the financial system is safer than previously and so too is the broader economy as a result.  Even if incidents such as Madoff or the Whale do not pose a systemic risk, this still leaves the difficult question of how to ensure that they do not slip past financial supervisors.  Even before the financial crisis, regulators already had ample powers to head off harmful behavior. The supervisors simply missed the London Whale, and missed Madoff despite people screaming at them to take notice.  Breaking up large banks would not address the root causes of the problems laid bare by Madoff, and would sacrifice the benefits to society from large financial institutions (yes, I am the usual two-handed economist, seeing both costs and benefits).  There is no simple remedy."

		"instruction": "Headline: Are Germany and France Drifting Apart?\nInstructions: Even as the debt crisis drove a wedge between struggling European nations and their more solvent neighbors, it seemed to be drawing France and Germany closer together. That is, until recently: Germany has emerged as a “have” and France looks like a “have not.” Are these two allies drifting apart? Have their interests diverged, so that any solution to the euro crisis that benefits one of them would harm the other?\n",
		"article_content": "The French satirical political TV puppet show Les Guignols recently parodied one of France’s darkest hours, picturing German tanks rolling up the Champs Elysées – except this time the French were welcoming them with open arms and begging for a bailout of their economy by Angela Merkel and her well-disciplined, austerity-forcing compatriots. This brought home cringingly the realization that French and German interests seemed no longer aligned and that Germany had “won” – certainly not the battle for the euro, but at least the one for political power in the euro zone.For months France and Germany appeared to manage the crisis hand in hand, figuratively as well as literally. Nicolas Sarkozy and Merkel were the latest in a long line of famous Franco-German political couples to display personal amity and convergence of interests over the past 50 years: General De Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer; Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Helmut Schmidt; François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl. Even if their assessment of the urgency of the situation and the solutions proposed differed, especially when it comes to the role of the European Central Bank as lender of last resort, France and Germany had been until now the uncontested tandem in charge and the only hope for solving the euro zone crisis.Will France continue to be part of the solution or become part of the problem? Sarkozy’s efforts to project Franco-German unity and keep France on an equal footing with Germany in managing the crisis, even as fears mount that France may be the next domino to fall in the euro zone, are particularly crucial for the French president in the context of the 2012 French presidential campaign. With polls putting him at a dismal 26 percent in next April’s contest, Sarkozy is trying to overcome his domestic handicap by projecting mastery of the economy in a difficult climate and demonstrating his capacity to deal with crises as they come. Therefore he has no interest in letting a rhetoric of Franco-German decoupling take hold.Instead, one can expect France to insist that the core interests are still converging on both sides of the Rhine: to prevent implosion of the euro zone, to preserve stability, to restore confidence, and not to squander more than five decades of painstakingly acquired European integration.Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

Meanwhile, three former U.S. ambassadors to Moscow are urging restraint.Should NATO be defending a nonmember nation? Are European leaders in a position to help Ukraine? \n",
		"article_content": "Whether Ukraine is a member of NATO matters less than whether defending it is in NATO’s security interest. Ukraine is not some distant microstate whose fate can be safely ignored; it is a country of 42 million people bordering on four NATO allies. The country attacking it borders on four more. In 2008 NATO promised Ukraine membership, once Kiev met the conditions and if it chose to apply.At the time of the Gulf War, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain  said: “Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which the United Nations stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel safe again.” Change that to read “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,\" and that is the reason NATO should support Ukraine. Inaction might encourage President Vladimir Putin to destabilize the Baltic States next, and other revisionist powers might follow his example elsewhere.No one wants war with a nuclear-armed Russia, but the West is not powerless. First, NATO allies can supply Ukraine with weapons, intelligence and training. The performance of Ukrainian armed forces was improving until recently, but they cannot withstand the Russian forces now in Ukraine.Second, the United States and especially the European Union can do much more to hit the Russian regime economically. Violating international law should have a cost. Sanctions may hurt fragile European economies, but they will hurt Russia more. For all the brave words of Russian leaders, replacing Europe as a market for Russian hydrocarbons and a source of goods and services would be tough and expensive. Third, the E.U. can help Ukraine to reform economically and politically. Putin wants to show that real democracy in the former Soviet Union always fails. A prosperous, modern Ukrainian state would be the best retort. "

		"instruction": "Headline: Can Greece’s Anti-Austerity Government Succeed?\nInstructions: After enduring five years of wrenching unemployment, devastating cuts to the social safety net and economic stagnation, all intended to help pay off enormous public debt, Greek voters on Sunday elected a government that has pledged to end the cuts and resist demand for full debt repayment.Can the new government, led by the left-wing Syriza party, succeed in lifting Greece out of its economic wreckage? Or, by rejecting the demands of its creditors, will Syriza only make things worse?\n",
		"article_content": "The reason for the meteoric rise of Syriza is clear. The Greek electorate has had enough of the imposition of the harsh austerity measures that are behind the bailout loan agreements that have been in effect since May 2010 when Greece was on the brink of an official default. Undoubtedly, a Greek default would have had a catastrophic impact on Europe’s major banks and could have led to the dissolution of the eurozone, at least in its present form, so a bailout by Greece’s euro partners was inevitable.But in seeking to ensure that Greece would keep up with its loan payments, its  international creditors -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – imposed draconian measures (slashing the government budget, forcing cuts in wages, salaries and pensions for both public and private sector employees, and demanding  radical structural reforms amid a crisis that actually increased the official unemployment rates), which led to the economy’s free fall and even raised substantially the nation’s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. Syriza’s opposition to austerity is backed by historical experience, with the best example being the Great Depression.  Indeed, the bulk of Syriza’s economic program for addressing the catastrophic crisis in Greece, which has evolved into a humanitarian crisis, is inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, though on a smaller scale, for obvious reasons. With Greece technically bankrupt and lacking its own sovereign currency, a Syriza-led government can only afford to propose moderate solutions that would ameliorate the worst aspects of the crisis.\n   \nOne of the main pillars of Syriza’s economic program is the creation of 300,000 new jobs for the unemployed under a direct public employment scheme. Such a program will provide relief for a sizable percentage of the long-term unemployed, will boost demand as the newly employed will increase their consumption, and will increase government revenue through the collection of additional direct and indirect taxes provided by the newly employed. The psychological rewards of such a program for the long-term unemployed are immeasurable. \nInterestingly, the task for the implementation of the employment program has been assigned to a colleague of mine at the Levy Institute, Rania Antonopoulos, who has been appointed deputy minister of Labor and Social Solidarity under a Syriza-led government.Syriza’s economic program also promises to increase the minimum monthly wage to pre-crisis levels. This wage increase will stimulate growth through additional spending in the economy and contribute to a decrease of the unemployment rate.Even so, it needs to be pointed out, that the prospects of a real Greek recovery will only improve substantially if the now unsustainable Greek public debt receives a generous “haircut.” Without it, a Syriza government, like Sisyphus, may be engaged in a never ending struggle to lift the country out of its extreme condition brought about by some five years of blind and violent austerity."

		"instruction": "Headline: Should Obama Speak Out on Iran?\nInstructions: Updated, June 18, 1:30 p.m. | Tamim Ansary, author of two books on the Middle East, has joined our discussion. He argues that the U.S. can promote its interest inIran best by doing least.\nOn Wednesday, as thousands of protesters continued to fill the streets in central Iran, the state-run media reported that the Iranian Foreign Ministry expressed displeasure at “interventionist” statements byAmerican officials. President Barack Obama said earlier this week that he was “deeply troubled by the violence” in Iran and that democratic values needed to be observed. But he also said that it wouldbe counterproductive for the United States “to be seen as meddling.”\nHe has come under some criticism for not calling the landslide victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a fraud. Senator John McCain, for one, said, “He should speak out that this is a corrupt, flawed sham ofan election and that the Iranian people have been deprived of their rights.”\nShould President Obama speak out more forcefully against the Iranian authorities and their tightening control of the press and the protesters? Or are there good reasons to be more cautious?\n",
		"article_content": "President Obama famously proclaimed in his inaugural speech: “To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that wewill extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.”\nNow that it is clear that the regime’s fist remains tightly clenched around the neck of the Iranian people, the Obama administration can not simply take a business-as-usual approach to Iran’s clericaldictatorship. This would send a dangerous signal to the regime that it can forcefully crush the demonstrations at little or no cost in terms of international pressure.\nPresident Obama must make it clear that the United States stands with the Iranian people, not with the repressive Islamist regime. He should strongly denounce the violent suppression of the democratic opposition andthe systematic human rights abuses perpetrated by regime. Moreover, he should call on other world leaders to cooperate in pressuring Tehran to end its persecution of political reformers, human rights activists,and religious minorities.\nThe Obama administration instead has muted its criticism of the regime, in the vain hope that this will improve the chances of successfully engaging Tehran diplomatically to defuse the slow motion crisis overIran’s nuclear program. But this diplomatic effort is likely to yield scant results anyway, given Tehran’s longstanding determination to continue on its nuclear path.\nTurning a blind eye to the regime’s excesses therefore is not likely to advance American interests on the nuclear front, but will only demoralize Iranian democratic and human rights activists and bolstera regime that fears, rather than seeks, better relations with the United States.\n"

		"instruction": "Headline: With Children, When Does Religion Go Too Far? \nInstructions: Parents often turn to their church, mosque or synagogue  to teach their children about morals and values, and to build self-esteem. And yet religions can be paternalistic and insular — indeed, some religious groups have even been accused of  child labor and possible human rights abuses. When does a religious upbringing cross the line from nurturing to oppressive?\n\n",
		"article_content": "We all need other people. Belonging to a group is a great way for us to connect with others. Psychology researchers have found that religious groups can be very positive for people’s health. However, not all religious groups are good for peoples' well-being and some can be downright harmful to some of their members, especially children. Some groups may offer a mixture of both positive and harmful elements. Groups can change, with a minority of them turning into what are commonly known as sects or high-demand groups, characterized, amongst other things, by control. That said, any group can become oppressive and controlling and any belief system can be taken and used as a tool to control others. For example, therapy and political groups can become sect-like in such a way that they begin to resemble religious sects. The practices and structure of some sects mean that children are growing up in an environment where they may be at risk of medical, physical, emotional or educational neglect, psychological maltreatment, and sometimes abuse in every sense of that word, even death. However, every sect is different and the experiences of children in sects differ. \n \nAll children, by reason of their physical size and developmental maturity, are vulnerable. The checks and balances that protect children and which we might expect to be present in most groups are usually absent from sects, as is compassion in general.  \nMany, if not most children raised in sects eventually leave, either with their parents, on their own or they may be kicked out. Understandably, young people exiting sects may feel overwhelmed. They are moving into a culture that they are usually completely unprepared for. They may have educational gaps, or lack socialization experiences and support. They have often just experienced the loss of all they have known.\n \nExtended family can be pivotal in providing support to those raised in these groups, although this is often lacking, particularly if extended family still belong to the sect. A safe place to stay, a little financial assistance, or a listening accepting ear can make a great deal of difference in the life of a young person exiting a sect. For a child in a sect, even just knowing that he has relatives outside of his group who are willing to provide assistance can act as a psychological life-line. As Truman Oler, who grew up in Fundamentalist Latter-day Saints group, which he left at age 19, stated:\n \n“One of the biggest factors in my leaving was my Grandma Lorna,\" who had left the group years earlier.  \"Grandma Lorna told me no matter what I did I was always going to have a place to come back to. That meant so much to me because I just didn't know where I'd go if I left.”\n \nBut many young people aren't so lucky. Perhaps the following words, written by a former sect member some years ago, might provide some inspiration: “Sometimes an ordinary life is an extraordinary achievement.\"Join Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.

		"instruction": "Headline: Avoiding a Time When Bacteria Can No Longer Be Stopped\nInstructions: The greatest medical miracle of the 20th century may become useless in the 21st century.  Bacterial resistance to antibiotics,   seen almost as soon as the medications were developed, has become a serious problem. Government efforts  to limit the extensive use of antibiotics by meat producers have been called inadequate. And hospitals have become a major source of antibiotic-resistant infections. How we can avoid a future in which antibiotics are no longer useful?\n",
		"article_content": "Eighty percent of the antibiotics produced in this country are sold for use in agriculture, so any solution to the antibiotic-resistance crisis has to start on the farm. Animals that are produced through the factory farm system are routinely given antibiotics at sub-therapeutic levels to promote growth and to compensate for unsanitary and crowded living conditions. As the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported, low-level doses of antibiotics kill off some of the weaker bacteria, but other strains survive and mutate to become more resistant to antibiotic treatment and more likely to cause serious disease. Then, when humans are infected with these antibiotic-resistant “superbugs,”  antibiotics are useless to treat the infections. A recent study that examined supermarket-bought chicken found approximately half of the samples contained bacteria resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics. Every year, at least 23,000 Americans die from antibiotics-resistant infections  – more than from  HIV/AIDS. \n \nUnfortunately, the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly failed to limit the industry use of antibiotics. Earlier this month, the agency urged drug companies and agriculture corporations to apply a standard of “judicious use” when distributing antibiotics to food animals. Considering the pharmaceutical and agribusiness industries have fought mandatory regulation for decades, it is difficult to see how such a voluntary approach, with no mechanism for enforcement, and no metric for success will be an adequate response. The F.D.A. has said it can't even tell how much of the industrial use of antibiotics is for disease prevention and how much is simply to promote growth.The proposed Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act would enact mandatory limits, preserving eight critical classes of antibiotics for use on humans and sick animals only. It is supported by over 450 medical and consumer advocacy groups, and is widely regarded by the scientific community as the only serious solution to the problem. Unfortunately, the agribusiness and pharmaceutical lobbies have worked very hard to obstruct meaningful regulation. Out of 225 lobbying reports filed in the 112th Congress on the legislation, 195 reports (87.5 percent) were submitted on behalf of entities hostile to the legislation. Only 30 (12.5 percent) were filed by medical and consumer advocacy groups. We have come too far as a society to fritter away the greatest medical discovery of all time just so the factory farm system doesn’t have to clean up its act. If we want to save antibiotics for their intended use – treating humans and sick animals – then Americans have to speak up and demand reforms from their government, and the F.D.A. and Congress have to listen and do their job."

That level of per-worker compensation is close to what it was in mid-2007, when Wall Streetwas booming.\nMany taxpayers might find the comeback of fat pay packages perplexing, especially since the federal government was throwing cash into the bank not that long ago.

And if a company wants to survive in a cyclical industry, it needs to keep total leverage low, have excess high-quality assets ready, avoid risks that competitors areembracing as a group and hire smart people.\nGoldman Sachs has survived the crisis in the brokerage space by doing essentially that. They kept leverage lower than their competitors; they salted away quality assets at Bank of New York; they raised capital whenthey needed to, paying Warren Buffett a pretty yield; they were quick to lay off risks; and they hired bright people who avoided taking underpriced risks that competitors did, like nonprime mortgages.\nCompanies that survive an industry crisis gain a disproportionate amount of the profits as they gain market share. Because of reduced competition, bid-ask spreads are wider, and a well-capitalized firm like Goldmanearns more.\nSome help from the government, through TARP, was forced on Goldman. Other help from the government was available to all; the government took the risk that healthy firms would benefit in order to avoid panic regardingunhealthy firms.\nIs Goldman connected with the government? Too much so.

		"article_content": "The temptation with heartbreak is to bury yourself in distraction — work, drinking, shopping, Tinder. Don’t. Heartbreak is grief and grief needs to be processed, not buried. Paradoxically, I’ve found staying present — I mean really, truly present to a single moment at a time — is the best way to work through heartbreak. For example, years ago I found myself in a terrible breakup — it was sudden, there was infidelity, kids were involved. One evening, right in the middle of it all, I was out with a group of people, eating sushi. I looked around the table and saw people laughing, making conversation. Suddenly I realized that, just in that very second, I was O.K. The moment was a surprisingly spacious place to be. As long as I disciplined myself not to jump into the future or the past — I was mostly fine. Yes, there will be moments of intense pain. But they will pass relatively quickly. Suffering is often caused more by the fear of what life will be without the relationship, or nostalgia for what has been lost — both essentially fantasies. Staying present also helps you learn what you need to learn — breakups always, always contain lessons — so when you are ready to move on, it can be to something better. "
